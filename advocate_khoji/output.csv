The Principal Sessions Judge, Kanyakumari District at Nagercoil, vide judgment and order dated 22nd March 2002, convicted the appellant for committing murder and sentenced him to life in prison together with fine of Rs.1000/-, in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 6 (six) months. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the Madras High Court, Madurai Bench, under section 374(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.The High Court, vide judgment and order dated 12th November 2009, allowed the appeal in part. The appellant was convicted for an offence under section 304-Part II, of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (""IPC"", hereafter) and sentenced to five years' rigorous imprisonment. Still dissatisfied, the judgment and order of the High Court has been carried by the appellant in appeal before this Court.Prosecution Case2. The prosecution case is that the victim, Palas, and his wife (PW-3) after returning from their respective jobs on 12th March, 1996, had been to a tea stall run by Velukutti (not examined). At the tea stall were present Ponnaian (not examined) and Wilson (PW-2). In their presence, Palas had demanded Rs.50/-, being his wages, from the appellant. Incidentally, Palas was a ""coconut cutting coolie"" working under the appellant.Hearing such demand, the appellant abused Palas in filthy language which was followed by physical abuses by and between them. Suddenly, the appellant picked up one rubber stick (lying on the back side of the tea stall) and hit Palas on the front and back sides of his head while exhorting him to get lost. On receiving such blow from the appellant, Palas fell down whereupon Ponnaian, Devaraj (PW-1) and PW-3 separated the two (appellant and Palas). Holding the rubber stick, the appellant threatened those present thereat that they would have to suffer the same consequences as Palas, if any of them challenged him.Thereafter, the appellant fled towards the north side. Palas was taken to a private nursing home, viz. Sivanandam Nursing Home at Panichamuttu (sic, Panachamoodu) village, Kanyakumari district, and admitted there on the same day. On 13th March, 1996, the doctor at the nursing home (PW-7) advised shifting of Palas to another hospital, whereafter he was taken to a government hospital, viz. Medical College and Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram (the nearest government hospital, although in a State different from the State where the alleged incident occurred). Palas was admitted there at on 13th March 1996 at 11.00 p.m. but, unfortunately, breathed his last on 14th March 1996 at about 07.15 p.m.A death intimation memo (Ex. P3) was issued by the doctor (PW-8). It was on the following day, i.e. 15th March 1996, that the first information report (""FIR"", hereafter) was registered on a complaint by Devaraj (PW-1) against the appellant for the offence punishable under section 302, IPC at Arumanai Police Station at about 09.00 a.m. On 15th March 1996 itself, post mortem was conducted by an Assistant Professor of Forensic Medicine and Deputy Police Surgeon, Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram (PW-9). The post mortem report (Ex. P5) revealed the opinion that ""head injury"" sustained by Palas was the cause of death.Proceedings before the Courts3. Before the Sessions Court, 11 (eleven) witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution. The trend of cross-examination suggested that Palas died of a head injury that he sustained due to a fall from a tree. While the Sessions Court was of the view that the prosecution had been successful in establishing the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt, the High Court while exercising appellate jurisdiction considered the oral testimony of PWs 2 & 3 and held that it had no hesitation to hold that it was the appellant who caused the head injury resulting in the death of Palas.However, at the same time, the High Court was of the view that the attendant circumstances and evidence brought on record unmistakably showed that the appellant may not have intended to cause the death of Palas. There was a quarrel between the appellant and Palas with regard to demand of wages prior to the occurrence, the appellant did not possess any weapon and that the appellant picked up the rubber stick from behind the tea stall and attacked Palas - all these led to the conclusion that there was no premeditation or intention on the part of the appellant to commit the murder of Palas.Being of the view that the incident of assault leading to the ultimate death of Palas had happened at the spur of the moment, the High Court was also of the view that Exception- II of section 300, IPC stood attracted and consequently, the appellant could not be held liable under section 302, IPC; instead, he would be liable for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under section 304-Part II, IPC. It was as a result of such a finding and recording of conviction that the High Court proceeded to impose on the appellant the sentence of 5 years' rigorous imprisonment.Appellant's arguments4. Appearing in support of the appeal, Mr. Basant, learned senior counsel contended that the High Court grossly erred in misreading the oral evidence on record as well as drawing conclusions from the documentary evidence led by the prosecution, without appreciating that the most vital evidence which could have clinched the issue was withheld by the prosecution by not examining the independent witnesses, viz. Ponnaian and Velukutti. Exception was next taken to delayed lodging of the FIR and it was asserted that the appellant had been falsely implicated.It was further contended by Mr. Basant that PW-7 had issued a certificate (Ex. P2) certifying that Palas had been treated at Sivanandan Nursing Home, Kanyakumari District on 12th March 1996 ""for injury on the scalp as an outpatient"". According to him, if indeed Palas had been assaulted by the appellant and such incident was witnessed at least by PWs 2 and 3, as part of normal human reaction, the person(s) taking Palas to the nursing home/hospital would be expected to disclose the factum of Palas having suffered head injury as a result of blows inflicted on him by the appellant; however, neither any disclosure was made of such assault nor the appellant was named as the assailant.There is also no evidence as to the nature of treatment extended to Palas on 12th March as well as on 13th March, 1996 prior to he being shifted to the government hospital at Thiruvananthapuram. No document regarding admission of Palas at such hospital as well as treatment rendered to him was also produced as evidence. Referring to Ex. P3, being the death intimation memo issued by PW-8, Mr. Basant contended that there was sufficient ground to believe that Palas had suffered injury as a result of a fall from the tree. Moreover, it was argued that the so-called rubber stick with which the appellant was alleged to have struck a blow on the head of Palas was not recovered. Finally, it was brought to our notice that PW-1, a so-called eyewitness and the first informant, had turned hostile.5. Resting on the aforesaid contentions, Mr. Basant urged that the prosecution had failed to prove that the appellant [who has unnecessarily suffered 11 (eleven) months incarceration] was instrumental in assaulting Palas which ultimately led to his death. It was, accordingly, prayed that the judgment and order under challenge be set aside and the appellant set free.Respondent's arguments6. Per contra, it was contended on behalf of the respondent by Dr. Aristotle, learned counsel that the judgment of the High Court convicting the appellant for the offence punishable under section 304-Part II, IPC is well reasoned and does not merit interference. PWs 2 and 3 were eyewitnesses to the assault on Palas by the appellant and nothing surfaced in course of their cross-examination to discredit them.The death of Palas was attributed to the head injury suffered by him on 12th March 1996 and injury nos. 1 and 2, indicated in the post mortem report, were sufficient to cause the death of Palas. It was further contended that any slip or laxity in investigation ought not to be given any importance, particularly when there are eye-witnesses of the crime. Dr. Aristotle further contended that delay in lodging an FIR is not always fatal and the prosecution case cannot be disbelieved merely because of minor contradictions in the testimony of witnesses which were recorded between 4 (four) to 6 (six) years after the incident.7. While concluding his address, Dr. Aristotle submitted that the High Court has exercised appellate power judiciously by returning a finding that the appellant was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and that the sentence imposed upon him neither being disproportionate nor shocking to the conscience of the Court, the same ought not to be interfered.The Question8. The question we are tasked to decide is whether, based on the evidence on record, the High Court was justified in returning a finding that the appellant was guilty of the offence punishable under section 304- Part II, IPC and liable to be sentenced as a consequence thereof, as has been imposed on him.Analysis9. We have meticulously perused the materials on record as well as considered the contentions advanced at the Bar with the care and attention the same deserve.10. In cases of the present nature, where material witnesses are withheld by the prosecution and it is the positive case set up by the defence that he has been falsely implicated for murder though death of the victim could be for reasons attributable to an accidental fall from a tree and such a case in defence finds some amount of corroboration from the other evidence on record, coupled with the fact that the appellate court has imposed a lesser sentence upon reversal of the finding of murder returned by the trial court, this Court as the court of last resort has a duty to separate the grain from the chaff and after sieving the untruth or unacceptable portion of the evidence, to also examine whether the residue is sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused.There seems to be no legal bar in convicting an accused resting on part of the evidence, which is primarily found to be credible and acceptable; however, where the evidence is so inseparable that any attempt to separate them would destroy the substratum on which the prosecution version is founded, then this Court would be within its legal limits to discard the evidence in its entirety. Bearing this settled principle in mind, we proceed to assess the evidence on record.11. We start with the FIR, to which exception has been taken by the appellant urging that there has been no satisfactory explanation for its belated registration. It is trite that merely because there is some delay in lodging an FIR, the same by itself and without anything more ought not to weigh in the mind of the courts in all cases as fatal for the prosecution.A realistic and pragmatic approach has to be adopted, keeping in mind the peculiarities of each particular case, to assess whether the unexplained delay in lodging the FIR is an afterthought to give a coloured version of the incident, which is sufficient to corrode the credibility of the prosecution version. In cases where delay occurs, it has to be tested on the anvil of other attending circumstances.If on an overall consideration of all relevant circumstances it appears to the court that the delay in lodging the FIR has been explained, mere delay cannot be sufficient to disbelieve the prosecution case; however, if the delay is not satisfactorily explained and it appears to the court that cause for the delay had been necessitated to frame anyone as an accused, there is no reason as to why the delay should not be considered as fatal forming part of several factors to vitiate the conviction.12. In the present case, we have noticed that the FIR was admittedly lodged on 15th March 1996 at about 09.00 a.m. although the incident was of 12th March 1996 and in between Palas was treated initially in a private nursing home and then in the government hospital where he passed away on 14th March 1996 around 07.15 p.m.From the evidence on record, what we find is that the crime was not reported to the police because, first, none of the doctors who had attended to Palas had advised PWs 2 and 3 to so report; secondly, PW-2 did not report out of fear as the appellant had threatened PWs 2 and 3; and thirdly, PW-3 wanted to save her husband. It is the oral evidence of a head constable who was posted at Arumanai Police Station (PW-10) that PW-1 had visited the police station on 15th March 1996 and given a statement (Ex. P7) based whereon the FIR (Ex. P8) was prepared.He admitted that no message was received prior to the FIR (Ex. P8) and that one police outpost is there within the campus of the Trivandrum Medical College. He also admitted that generally an FIR should be registered at the police outpost prior to admitting the patient for treatment and that such FIR should be forwarded to the police station. It is also in the evidence of the Inspector of Police, Arumanai Police Station (PW-11) that the place of occurrence is at a distance of 15 kms. from his police station.13. Upon consideration of the other circumstances, belated reporting of the crime to the police resulting in undue delay would bear relevance and we need to arrive at a conclusion as to whether what the PWs 2 and 3 deposed could be regarded as explanations worthy of acceptance for not reporting the crime to the police between 12th March 1996 (evening) and 15th March 1996 (before 9.00 a.m.).14. PW-2 deposed that he had taken Palas to Sivanandan Nursing Home and had stated to the doctor (PW-7) that the appellant had hit Palas with a rubber stick. Such version of PW-2 has been contradicted by PW-7. According to PW-7, Palas was brought to the nursing home on 12th March at about 07.30 p.m. Since he had injury on his head, PW-7 provided first aid to him.At such nursing home, Palas received treatment for a day whereafter he was advised by PW-7 to be admitted at a government hospital. It is in the version of PW-7 that information would have been given to the police had he been told that Palas was attacked by somebody. It is, therefore, clear that the version of PW-7 has a different tale to tell.15. Moving on to the oral testimony of the witnesses, what we have to bear in mind is section 134 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (""Evidence Act"", hereafter) and the categorization of oral testimony into witnesses who are (i) wholly reliable; (ii) wholly unreliable; and (iii) neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable. It is not the quantity but the quality of evidence that would matter.16. PWs 2 and 3 were the star witnesses for the prosecution, having deposed to have not only been present at the place of occurrence but also having witnessed the quarrel between Palas and the accused over wages demanded by the former and the subsequent blow inflicted by the latter. PW-2 in course of cross-examination admitted of the existence of a police station 10 kms. away and that vehicle facility to reach there was available.He simply avoided responsibility by deposing that PW-8 did not advise him to report to the police outpost, which was within the campus of the hospital. PW-3 in course of her cross-examination (conducted a little less than 4 years from the date of incident) could recollect the incident and all follow up steps sequentially, and went on to depose that she chose not to report the crime or have the same reported since she decided to save Palas.There could be nothing unusual if safety of her husband was the prime consideration of PW-3. However, what is striking is that PW-3 could not recall as to whether she had stated at the hospital that the appellant had attacked Palas with the rubber stick. She shrugged off the responsibility by deposing that someone else must have disclosed to the doctor regarding the injury sustained by Palas.17. In the light of the above explanation proffered by PWs 2 and 3, which does not appear to us to be reliable and acceptable, we do feel that the absence of Ponnaian and Velukutti assumes importance. In fact, their absence has the effect of seriously damaging the prosecution case and rendering it quite unreliable.18. It is in the deposition of PW-11 that PW-10 had recorded the statement of, inter alia, Velukutti earlier and that PW-11 himself had recorded the statements of PWs 1, 2 and 3 as well as Ponnaian. Ponnaian and Velukutti were admittedly present at the tea stall when the alleged incident of assault took place (version of PWs 2 & 3).The prosecution has not explained why Ponnaian and Velikutti were not called upon to depose despite they being present at the place of occurrence and despite their statements having been recorded in course of investigation. If indeed they were unavailable to depose, it was incumbent on the prosecution to adduce relevant evidence in that regard. The prosecution having not examined Ponnaian and Velikutti, illustration (g) of section 114 of the Evidence Act is well and truly attracted in the present case.19. Next, there is something noteworthy about the injury inflicted on Palas if at all the version of the prosecution is to be believed. PW-2 in course of cross-examination deposed that Palas had suffered a ""small injury"". It is also in the evidence of PW-7 that after Palas was brought to Sivanandam Nursing Home, he was provided first aid by PW-7.Providing first aid to Palas coupled with the statement of PW-2 of a small injury having been suffered by Palas, it is not unreasonable to presume that the injury was obviously not too serious and Palas himself was in a position to say how he had suffered the injury. From the evidence of the two doctors, viz. PWs 7 and 8, it does not appear that Palas was physically disabled to speak or that any conversation took place in course whereof Palas did disclose that he was assaulted by the appellant.It was incumbent on the prosecution to produce documents relating to admission of Palas in the nursing home and at the government hospital as well as those relating to his treatment to prove that Palas himself was not in a position to speak. None of these medical documents having been produced, there is no corroboration that the head injury which Palas suffered was caused by the blow of the rubber stick and also that the same could not have been suffered as a result of a fall from the tree.20. That apart, it is seen from the evidence of the autopsy surgeon (PW-9) that there were several scratch injuries suffered by Palas near to his left shoulder, on his left elbow, on his upper right thumb, and lower to left knee on his left foreleg. Most importantly, there was a lacerated injury on the corner of the tongue. It was not elicited from PW-9 how these injuries could have been sustained by Palas; on the contrary, the chemical examiner's report dated 31st March 1999 (Ex. P6) reveals positive results for Indoform, Dichromate and Ethyl Acetate tests.Presence of ethyl alcohol in the blood, liver and kidney of Palas, which was not disputed by PW-9 and his further statement that ""liquor was remained up to 3 days"" coupled with his testimony in course of cross-examination that it is ""possible to have sustain injuries found on head if a person fallen down from a high tree"", gives us reason to entertain serious doubts about the prosecution case which get amplified by what is discussed now.21. Ex. P3, being the death intimation memo, is of some significance. The contents thereof are not entirely in the handwriting of PW-8. PW-8 while admitting his signature at the foot of Ex. P3, cleared the position that the contents on the first page were written by the hospital staff. The contents on the reverse are definitely not in the handwriting of PW-8 but reveals the words ""fall from tree"".The prosecution has not made any attempt to explain how these words came to be written on Ex. P3 and by whom. Significantly, no circumstance has been brought on record to attribute such writing to the appellant. Had Ex. P3 been entirely written by PW-8 and the words ""fall from tree"" by someone else, this document would have been of no importance at all; however, in the absence of any explanation proffered by the prosecution, it constitutes another important material to doubt the prosecution case of the appellant being responsible for the death of Palas.All circumstances taken together tilt more towards the inference that Palas was under the influence of alcohol, did fall from a tree, had a head injury and several scratch injuries and, most importantly, in the process of the fall and hitting the ground, bit his tongue resulting in the lacerated injury spoken of by PW-9.These injuries, we are minded to believe, were not suspected to be serious injuries at the inception warranting admission of Palas in a government hospital or even to report such incident to the police but the situation having taken a turn for the worse and to evade responsibility, the appellant had been framed possibly in connivance with one Radhakrishnan (not examined) whose role surfaces from what is referred to by PW-1.22. The deposition of PW-1 arouses suspicion as to the incident in question. He is the younger brother of Palas and the first informant; however, he was declared hostile by the prosecution after having spoken of his unawareness of the occurrence. PW-1 thereafter proceeded to give an ocular version as if he was an eyewitness. According to him, after seeing the occurrence, Ponnaian as well as PWs 2 and 3 came to the place of occurrence and separated the appellant and Palas.Thereafter he (PW- 1), Ponnaian and PWs 2 and 3 took Palas to Sivanandan Nursing Home. During cross-examination by the appellant, PW-1 spoke of one Radhakrishnan (according to PW-3, Radhakrishnan is PW-3's sister's husband) and police of Arumanai Police Station having obtained the signature of PW-1 on ""one paper"". This is an additional circumstance that renders the prosecution version not wholly acceptable.23. Although not brought to our notice in course of arguments, it is revealed from the oral testimony of PW-11 that the appellant could be apprehended 3 (three) years after the incident from Puliyur road junction in (1 km. away from Ambalakalai) in Kerala after vigorous search. However, abscondence by a person against whom an FIR has been lodged and who is under expectation of being apprehended is not very unnatural.Mere absconding by the appellant after alleged commission of crime and remaining untraceable for such a long time itself cannot establish his guilt or his guilty conscience. Abscondence, in certain cases, could constitute a relevant piece of evidence, but its evidentiary value depends upon the surrounding circumstances. This sole circumstance, therefore, does not enure to the benefit of the prosecution.24. Viewed in the light of the delay in lodging of the FIR and on threadbare consideration of the other evidence on record, the circumstances surrounding the unfortunate death of Palas do not clearly and unequivocally point to the involvement of the appellant and his false implication cannot be wholly ruled out.Conclusion25. We are of the firm opinion, having regard to the aforesaid discussion, that the prosecution cannot be held to have established even the accusation of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and to extend the benefit of doubt to him is what the justice of the case demands; hence, he is entitled to be acquitted. Ordered accordingly.26. The appeal succeeds. The judgment and order dated 12th November 2009, which is under challenge in this appeal, stands set aside.The appellant shall be set free, unless he is wanted in any other case.He stands discharged of his bail bonds.......................J.

1,"Purushothaman Vs. State of Tamil Nadu[Criminal Appeal No. 3341 of 2023 arising out of S.L.P.(Crl.) No. 8609 of 2023]Abhay S.Oka, J.1. Leave granted.2. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties.3. The appellant-accused was convicted by the Trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO Act'). The appeal against conviction preferred by the appellant was admitted by the High Court and by the order dated 12th January, 2018, the substantive sentence of the appellant was suspended and he was ordered to be enlarged on bail.4. On 7th July, 2023, the said Criminal Appeal of the year 2017 was called out before the learned Single Judge of the High Court for hearing. The Advocate for the appellant sought adjournment for four weeks. Only on the ground that the appellant is enjoying the facility of bail and that his advocate applied for adjournment, the High Court proceeded to cancel the bail.5. In a given case, if the advocate appearing for the appellant-accused seeks adjournment on untenable and unreasonable grounds, the Appellate Court is well within its power to refuse the prayer for adjournment. In such a case, one of the courses suggested by a decision of this Court in the case of Bani Singh v. State of U.P.1 can always be adopted by the High Court.The High Court has a discretion to appoint an advocate to espouse the cause of the appellant when the advocate appointed by the appellant refuses to argue the appeal on unreasonable grounds. Though the High Court has an option of considering the merits of the appeal and deciding the same on merits, the High Court could always adopt the first course of appointing an advocate to espouse the cause of the appellant.6. Sub-section 1 of Section 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short ""CrPC"") reads thus:""389. Suspension of sentence pending the appeal; release of appellant on bail -(1) Pending any appeal by a convicted person, the Appellate Court may, for reasons to be recorded by it in writing, order that the execution of the sentence or order appealed against be suspended and, also, if he is in confinement, that he be released on bail, or on his own bond.Provided that the Appellate Court shall, before releasing on bail or on his own bond a convicted person who is convicted of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years, shall give opportunity to the Public Prosecutor for showing cause in writing against such release:Provided further that in cases where a convicted person is released on bail it shall be open to the Public Prosecutor to file an application for the cancellation of the bail.""(underline supplied)7. Under sub-section 1 of Section 389, while suspending the sentence of the appellant-accused who is in Jail, the Appellate Court has to enlarge the accused on bail till the final disposal of the appeal. The second proviso to sub-section 1 of Section 389 permits the Public Prosecutor to file an application for cancellation of the bail granted under sub-section 1.The second proviso to sub-section 1 of Section 389 is on par with sub-section 2 of Section 439 of CrPC. Therefore, the Court can even Suo Motu issue a notice calling upon the accused to show cause why the bail should not be cancelled. Under no circumstances, the bail granted to an accused under sub-section 1 of Section 389 can be cancelled without giving a reasonable opportunity to the accused of being heard.8. Unfortunately, the High Court, without even giving an opportunity of being heard to the appellant-accused on the issue of cancellation of bail, has straight away proceeded to cancel the bail granted to him. Such approach on the part of the High Court cannot be countenanced especially when the High Court can always deal with the situation when an adjournment is sought by the advocate for the accused at the time of final hearing of the appeal on unreasonable grounds.For the default of the advocate appointed by the accused, the Appellate Court cannot penalize the accused by proceeding to cancel his bail only on the ground that his advocate has sought adjournment and that also without giving an opportunity of being heard to him on the issue of cancellation of bail.9. We have come across cases where an application for suspension of sentence was rejected by the High Court only on the ground that the advocate for the accused declined to argue the appeal on merits. When only the application for suspension of sentence is listed for hearing, the advocate for the accused is not expected to be ready to argue the appeal.10. Accordingly, the impugned order is hereby quashed and set aside and the earlier order dated 12th January, 2018 granting suspension of sentence and bail to the appellant is restored.11. We make it clear that if the appellant applies for adjournment on any unreasonable or unwarranted ground, it will be always open for the High Court to proceed with the appeal by taking recourse to one of the options laid down in the case of Bani Singh1.12.

2,"Moorthy Vs. State of Tamil Nadu[Criminal Appeal No. 975 o 2011]Abhay S. Oka, J.Factual Aspects1. The appellant was convicted for the offences punishable under Sections 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (for short, 'IPC'). He was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment for the offence punishable under Section 302 and rigorous imprisonment for seven years for the offence punishable under Section 201, IPC. Sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The appeal preferred by the appellant has been dismissed by the High Court by the impugned judgment.2. The deceased Shanthi was the wife of the appellant. According to the prosecution case, the appellant suspected that the deceased had illicit intimacy with one Peethambaram. On 29th May 2006 at about 9:00 p.m., the appellant took the deceased to the bank of Ponnai River and assaulted her with a stick. The said Shanthi succumbed to the injuries. He buried the dead body in the same place. PW Nos.3 and 4 are the parents of the deceased who were enquiring with the appellant about the whereabouts of the deceased. However, the appellant told them that the deceased was missing.3. The prosecution relied upon the extrajudicial confession made by the appellant before PW1 Ganesan Perumal in the presence of PW2 Tyagarajan Kannan. Secondly, the prosecution relied upon the recovery of the dead body and the stick allegedly used as a weapon of assault at the instance of the appellant. Thirdly, according to the prosecution, the skeleton was identified by PW nos.3 and 4 on the basis of the clothes thereon.Submissions4. The main submission of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant is that PW nos.1 and 2 were complete strangers to the appellant. Moreover, the alleged extrajudicial confession was made by the appellant before the said two witnesses 2 months and 11 days after the date of the incident.The learned counsel further submitted that the conduct of PW1 who was the Village Administrative Officer, does not inspire confidence as he immediately did not report the matter to the police. The learned counsel further submitted that the identity of the body/skeleton was not established. He submitted that recourse was not taken to DNA test for identification of the skeleton.He also submitted that there is a material discrepancy in the evidence of PW18 Investigating Officer and PW1 about the place from which the stick, which was the weapon of offence, was discovered. He pointed out that PW nos.8 to 11 who were cited as witnesses to support the theory of last seen together, did not support the prosecution.5. Dr. Joseph Aristotle, the learned counsel appearing for the State submitted that there are no major discrepancies and contradictions in the version of PW nos.1 and 18. He submitted that though PW8 was declared as hostile, his evidence cannot be discarded in its entirety. He placed reliance on a decision of this Court in the case of Rameshbhai Mohanbhai Koli & Ors. v. State of Gujarat1. He submitted that the discovery of the dead body at the instance of the appellant is a very important circumstance against the accused. He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Anuj Kumar Gupta v. State of Bihar2.Our View6. Firstly, we will deal with the prosecution case about the extrajudicial confession. As regards extrajudicial confession, the law has been laid down by this Court in the case of Pawan Kumar Chourasia v. State of Bihar3. In paragraph 5 it is held thus:""5. As far as extrajudicial confession is concerned, the law is well settled. Generally, it is a weak piece of evidence. However, a conviction can be sustained on the basis of extrajudicial confession provided that the confession is proved to be voluntary and truthful. It should be free of any inducement. The evidentiary value of such confession also depends on the person to whom it is made. Going by the natural course of human conduct, normally, a person would confide about a crime committed by him only with such a person in whom he has implicit faith.Normally, a person would not make a confession to someone who is totally a stranger to him. Moreover, the Court has to be satisfied with the reliability of the confession keeping in view the circumstances in which it is made. As a matter of rule, corroboration is not required. However, if an extrajudicial confession is corroborated by other evidence on record, it acquires more credibility.""(emphasis added)7. We have perused the evidence of PW1 Ganesan who was posted as the Village Administrative Officer at the time of the commission of the offence. He was not permanently posted in Village Seekkarajapuram as he stated that at the time of recording of evidence, he was transferred as Village Administrative Officer to Ranipet. PW1 admitted in the crossexamination that he did not know the appellant before he came to him and allegedly made the extrajudicial confession. The incident is of 29th May 2006 but the alleged extrajudicial confession was made on 10th August 2006.It is impossible to understand why would the appellant meet the Village Administrative Officer, who was a total stranger to him, more than two months after the incident for making a confession. PW1 and the appellant were not known to each other till 10th of August 2006. Normally an accused will confide only with a person in whom he has implicit faith. He would not go to a stranger to make a confession of guilt. The fact that the alleged confession was made by him more than two months after the incident makes it more suspicious.8. PW1 claims that he recorded the statement of the appellant and took a thumb impression of the appellant. There is no evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove the thumb impression. PW1 claims that after making the confession, the appellant took him to the place of the incident which is located near the railway overbridge on the bank of the river Ponnai. PW1 did not take the appellant to the police station after the alleged confession was made.He admittedly did not inform the police immediately after recording the alleged extrajudicial confession. PW1 claims that he visited the place of incident with the appellant who showed him the scene of the alleged offence. Only thereafter he took the appellant to the police. It is also pertinent to note that in his crossexamination, PW1 admitted that there were 67 huts near the place of residence of the appellant and the families residing therein belonged to the same caste as that of the appellant. Thus, there were people around before whom the appellant could have confessed.9. PW2 was working as an Assistant with PW1. He has deposed on the same lines as PW1. However, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant confided with PW2. He was present when the appellant allegedly made an extrajudicial confession and was recorded by PW1. He stated that he along with PW1 were taken by the appellant to the place where he committed murder and buried the body. He claimed in the crossexamination that he knew the appellant before the incident but the appellant did not confide before him.10. Extrajudicial confession is always a weak piece of evidence and in this case, for the reasons which we have recorded earlier, there is serious doubt about the genuineness of the prosecution case regarding the extrajudicial confession. Therefore, the prosecution case about the extra judicial confession does not deserve acceptance.11. Now we consider the evidence of PW18 who is the Investigating Officer. He stated that the dead body was found at a depth of 2 ft. after digging. He stated in the crossexamination that the stick allegedly used by the appellant as a weapon of assault was recovered from a bush at a distance of 50 feet from the place where the dead body was found. He accepted in the crossexamination that none of the relatives had lodged a missing complaint.12. As far as the alleged recovery of the dead body at the instance of the appellant is concerned, we must note that the dead body was recovered from a place which was accessible to all. A day prior to the alleged discovery at the instance of the appellant, PW nos.1 and 2 had gone to the place where the dead body was found. It is not the case of the prosecution that the place where the dead body was buried was accessible and known only to the appellant. This also raises serious doubt about the theory of the prosecution about the discovery of the body at the instance of the appellant.13. PW nos.3 and 4 have deposed mainly on the issue of the identity of the dead body as they were present when the dead body was recovered. However, the body had decomposed and only the skeleton was exhumed. In the crossexamination, PW3 Rajagopalan, the father of the deceased, stated that the appellant came to him one month prior to the date of knowledge of the murder of his daughter. PW3 stated that at that time the appellant asked him whether he had murdered the deceased. He stated that the appellant went to the police station to lodge a complaint. PW3 accepted that he did not search for his daughter and did not file any missing complaint. This conduct of PW3 is not natural.14. If we peruse the evidence of PW1 and PW18, the recovery of the weapon of the offence at the instance of the appellant becomes extremely doubtful. PW1 deposed that the stick was buried 1 ft deep in the river bank about 5 ft away towards the west of the place in which the body was buried. However, PW18 stated that the stick was recovered from a bush at a distance of about 50 ft. on the north of the place where the dead body was buried. This also makes the prosecution case vulnerable as far as the discovery of the stick at the instance of the appellant is concerned.15. Though the respondent tried to rely upon the evidence of PW8 who has been declared hostile, we find that he had made a general statement that he had seen the appellant and deceased together two years back. Moreover, the other witnesses examined to prove the last seen together theory were declared hostile. Thus, the prosecution could not establish the last seen together theory.16. There is serious doubt about the genuineness of the prosecution case regarding the recovery of a dead body at the instance of the appellant and the recovery of the alleged instrument of the offence at the instance of the appellant. Most importantly, for the reasons we have recorded earlier, it is not possible to accept the case of the prosecution which is entirely based on the extrajudicial confession made by the appellant. Thus, there was no legal evidence on record to convict the appellant. In any case, the guilt of the appellant has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.17. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The judgment and order dated 31st March 2008 passed by the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No.24 of 2008 as well as the impugned judgment and order dated 28th January 2009 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Criminal Appeal No.394 of 2008 are hereby set aside and the appellant is acquitted of the offences alleged against him.18.

3,"Mariappan Vs. State of Tamil Nadu[Criminal Appeal No. 926 of 2009]P. Sathasivam, J.1) This appeal has been filed against the final judgment and order dated17.10.2006 passed by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1556 of 2003, whereby the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and confirmed the order dated 29.08.2003 passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court No. IV),Madurai at Periakulam in S.C. No. 390 of 2002.2) Brief factsa) The case on hand relates to the death of a woman in her house over a land dispute by the appellant-accused, claiming the plea of insanity under Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short 'the IPC'). Parvathi @Kili (the deceased), her husband Parasivam Chettiar (PW-6) and their granddaughters viz., Chellakili (PW-1) and Parmala (PW-2) were living together at Ammapatti village. The deceased was the paternal aunt of the appellant-accused.b) There was a dispute between the family of the appellant-accused and the deceased over a portion of land belonging to one Chinnamanur Pillayar Kovil, which was taken on lease by PW-6 through one Chinnamanur Karuvaya Pillai. The family of the appellant-accused claimed that the said land was only leased out to them. When the family of the appellant-accused demanded to hand over the disputed land, PW-6, in turn, after the death of the said Chinnamanur Karuvaya Pillai, handed over the land to one Karuppaya Pillai (PW-11), son of Karuvaya Pillai which resulted in strained relationship between both the families as the appellant-accused was demanding money for the same.c) One day prior to the date of occurrence, i.e., on 04.11.2001, when PWs 1 and 2 were also at home, the appellant-accused came to the house of the deceased and questioned about the whereabouts of PW-6 and also told her that they have taken their land and money and threatened to kill them. At that time, PW-5, brother-in-law of PW-6 came there and pacified the appellant-accused. Thereafter, the appellant-accused left the place by saying that he would come again tomorrow and warned that if the money is not paid, he would kill her and her husband.d) On 05.11.2001, at 8.00 a.m., while the deceased was in the kitchen, the appellant-accused entered into the house and closed the door from inside. When PWs 1 & 2 asked about the conduct of the appellant-accused, he said that if the deceased and her husband are not paying his money, he is going to kill them and went to the kitchen. Thereafter, the appellant-accused pulled the tuft of the deceased in his left hand and gave a cut on her neck with Aruval and when she warded off with her right hand, it resulted into injuries to her fingers. At that time, PWs 1 & 2 requested the accused to leave her. Again, the accused caught hold of the tuft of her in his left hand and gave repeated Aruval blows on her head as a result of which she died instantaneously. Thereafter, the accused left the place with Aruval in his hand and after opening the door he said that he is going to kill PW-6 also. On raising hue and cry by PWs 1 & 2, the neighbors came there. PW-1 along with PW-5 went to the Uthamapalayam Police Station and after recording the statement given by PW-1 the sub-Inspector of Police (PW-16) registered a case being Crime No. 386 of 2001 for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the IPC. On the same day, at 4.30 p.m., the appellant-accused was arrested and the dead body was also sent for postmortem. After completion of the investigation, a charge sheet was filed and the case was committed to the Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge, (Fast Track Court No. IV) Madurai at Periakulam and numbered as Sessions Case No. 390/2002.e) The Additional District and Sessions Judge, by order dated29.08.2003, convicted the appellant-accused under Sections 449 and 302 of IPC and sentenced him to undergo RI for 5 years under Section 449 of IPC along with a fine of Rs.5,000/-, in default, to further undergo RI for 1(one) year and to undergo RI for life for the offence under Section 302 of IPC along with a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default, to further undergo RI for5 years.f) Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed an appeal being Criminal Appeal No. 1556 of 2003 before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. By impugned judgment dated 17.10.2006, the High Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order dated 29.08.2003 passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court No. IV), Madurai.g) Against the said order, the appellant-accused has filed this appeal by way of special leave petition.3) Heard Mr. Anil Shrivastav, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. M. Yogesh Khanna, learned counsel for the respondent-State.4) The one and only contention projected by learned counsel for the appellant-accused is that at the time of the alleged incident, the accused was suffering from ""Paranoid Schizophrenia"" and, hence, he is entitled to the benefit of exception under Section 84 of IPC. Discussion:5) Before considering the above issue, it is to be noted that whether the prosecution has established the guilt against the accused by examining PWs 1 and 2, the grand daughters of the deceased Parvathi, as eye-witnesses. It is the evidence of PW-6 - husband of the deceased that one day before the date of incident, when PWs 1 and 2 were at home along with his wife-Parvathi, the appellant-accused came to their house and demanded money and also threatened her before leaving the place that he would come again tomorrow and if money is not paid, he would kill both the deceased and her husband PW-6. It is also stated by PWs 1 and 2 that on the next day, at 8.00 a.m., when the deceased was cooking food in the kitchen, the accused trespassed into the house, bolted the door from inside and, thereafter, caused fatal injuries to the deceased with the Aruval. It is further stated that on raising hue and cry, PWs 3 and 4, the neighbours, came at the spot and saw the accused running from the house with aruval.6) The evidence of PWs 3 and 5-the neighbours, proves the occurrence that had happened one day prior to the date of the incident and also the shoutings of the accused-appellant threatening and demanding money. PW-6has also explained in his evidence about the dispute relating to the lease of the temple land through one Chinnamanur Kuruvaya Pillai and handing over the said land to PW-11, son of the said Chinnamanur Kuruvaya Pillai. According to PW-6, because of the said land, there were strained relationship between the two families for more than 10 years and the appellant-accused used to quarrel with him and his wife as to how the land leased out to their family could be handed over to PW-11 and was demanding money for the same.7) The evidence of PWs 1 and 2 - the eye-witnesses, the evidence of PWs3 and 4, who saw the accused running after the occurrence with Aruval(M.O.1) and the recovery of the weapon at the instance of the accused which was found to be stained with human blood of ""O"" group, as per the serologist report (Ex.P.12), tallied with the blood group of the deceased as the clothes of the deceased viz., M.O.s 1 to 4 were also stained with human blood ""O"" group clearly prove the case of the prosecution. Further, the medical evidence through PW-9-the Doctor, who conducted the post mortem and issued the report (Ex.P-3) strengthened the version of PWs 1 and 2.8) From the materials analyzed, discussed and concluded by the trial Court and the High Court, it clearly establishes that it was the accused-appellant who committed the murder.9) Coming to the only contention put-forward by the appellant-accused that the accused was suffering from Paranoid Schizophrenia, learned counsel or the appellant placed reliance on the evidence of DW-1-the Doctor attached to Government Rajaji Hosital, Madurai who treated the accused from11.07.2001 to 08.08.2001. In his evidence, DW-1 has stated that the accused was suffering from Paranoid Schizophrenia. The other material relied on in support of the plea of insanity is Ex. D-2, the termination order of the Inspector General of Police, Northern Sector, CRPF, New Delhi wherein it is stated that the accused is medically unfit for service in CRPF due to Paranoid Schizophrenia. It is further contended that the appellant has also relied on the statement of PW-2, grand-daughter of the deceased, that the wife of the accused obtained divorce on the ground that the accused was mentally ill.10) Since the appellant has raised the plea of insanity seeking protection under Section 84 of the IPC, it is useful to refer the same: ""84. Act of a person of unsound mind.- Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.""The above section makes it clear that a person, who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, commits anything, he is permitted to claim the above exception. (emphasis supplied). In other words, insanity or unsoundness of mind are the stages when a person is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or unable to understand what is wrong or right relate to the period in which the offence has been committed.11) It is also useful to refer Section 105 of the Indian Evidence Act,1872 which reads as under: ""105. Burden of proving that case of accused comes within exceptions.- When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the General Exceptions in the Indian Penal Code, (45 of 1860), or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.""Though the burden of proving an offence is always on the prosecution and never shifts, however, the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the exception under Section 84 IPC lies on the accused.12) With these provisions, let us examine whether at the time of the incident, the accused was suffering from unsoundness of mind, i.e., on05.11.2001.13) Learned counsel for the appellant-accused heavily relied on the decision of this Court in Shrikant Anandrao Bhosale vs. State of Maharashtra, (2002) 7 SCC 748 wherein this Court considered the similar issue. A reference made from Modi's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology,22nd Edition, as quoted in paras 10 and 11 are relevant, which reads thus: ""10. What is paranoid schizophrenia, when it starts, what are its characteristics and dangers flowing from this ailment? Paranoid schizophrenia, in the vast majority of cases, starts in the fourth decade and develops insidiously. Suspiciousness is the characteristic symptom of the early stage. Ideas of reference occur, which gradually develop into delusions of persecution. Auditory hallucinations follow, which in the beginning, start as sounds or noises in the ears, but afterwards change into abuses or insults.Delusions are at first indefinite, but gradually they become fixed and definite, to lead the patient to believe that he is persecuted by some unknown person or some superhuman agency. He believes that his food is being poisoned, some noxious gases are blown into his room and people are plotting against him to ruin him. Disturbances of general sensation give rise to hallucinations, which are attributed to the effects of hypnotism, electricity, wireless telegraphy or atomic agencies. The patient gets very irritated and excited owing to these painful and disagreeable hallucinations and delusions. Since so many people are against him and are interested in his ruin, he comes to believe that he must be a very important man. The nature of delusions thus may change from persecutory to the grandiose type.He entertains delusions of grandeur, power and wealth, and generally conducts himself in a haughty and overbearing manner. The patient usually retains his memory and orientation and does not show signs of insanity, until the conversation is directed to the particular type of delusion from which he is suffering. When delusions affect his behaviour, he is often a source of danger to himself and to others. (Modi's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, 22nd Edn.) 11. Further, according to Modi, the cause of schizophrenia is still not known but heredity plays a part. The irritation and excitement are effects of illness. On delusion affecting the behaviour of a patient, he is a source of danger to himself and to others.""14) It is useful to refer the decision relied on by learned counsel forthe State i.e. Sudhakaran vs. State of Kerala, (2010) 10 SCC 582. Thefacts in that case are identical to the case on hand. Here again, thisCourt referred to Modi's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, 23rdEdition about paranoid schizophrenia. The following statement in paras 26and 28 are relevant: ""26. The defence of insanity has been well known in the English legal system for many centuries. In the earlier times, it was usually advanced as a justification for seeking pardon. Over a period of time, it was used as a complete defence to criminal liability in offences involving mensrea. It is also accepted that insanity in medical terms is distinguishable from legal insanity. In most cases, in India, the defence of insanity seems to be pleaded where the offender is said to be suffering from the disease of schizophrenia. 28. The medical profession would undoubtedly treat the appellant herein as a mentally sick person. However, for the purposes of claiming the benefit of the defence of insanity in law, the appellant would have to prove that his cognitive faculties were so impaired, at the time when the crime was committed, as not to know the nature of the act.""15) After adverting to Sections 84 and 299 IPC and Sections 105 and 101of the Evidence Act, this Court concluded that ""when a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, the burden of proof lies on that person"". This Court also held as under: ""35. It is also a settled proposition of law that the crucial point of time for ascertaining the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the purview of Section 84 is the time when the offence is committed. We may notice here the observations made by this Court in Ratan Lal v. State of M.P. In para 2 of the aforesaid judgment, it is held as follows: ""It is now well settled that the crucial point of time at which unsoundness of mind should be established is the time when the crime is actually committed and the burden of proving this lies on the [appellant].""As concluded, we also reiterate that at the time of commission of offence, the physical and mental condition of the person concerned is paramount for bringing the case within the purview of Section 84.16) In the case on hand, though the Doctor (DW-1) attached with the Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, who treated the accused from11.07.2001 to 08.08.2001 has stated that the appellant-accused was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, it is not in dispute that after08.08.2001, there is no material or information on record that he was suffering from the same. It is relevant to mention that the date of occurrence was 05.11.2001 i.e. nearly after three months of the treatment by DW-1. In the same way, Ex. D-2, the termination order of the Inspector General of Police, Northern Sector, CRPF, New Delhi is also not helpful because of the language used in Section 84 of IPC. As a matter of fact, DW-2, father of the accused-appellant has not stated anything about the behaviour of the deceased. He has also not stated anything that he is a mentally ill person and not able to do his routine works properly. In fact, it was brought to our notice that in Ex. D-2, which is a letter from the Department, it is seen that the appellant-accused made a written request for rejoining stating improvement in his health.17) It is also relevant to note that the appellant came to the house one day prior to the occurrence, demanded money and threatened the deceased of grave consequences and on the next day, when the demand was not fulfilled, he trespassed into the house, pushed away PWs 1 and 2, bolted the door from inside and inflicted repeated aruval blows on the deceased resulted into her death. All these aspects also show that at the relevant time, he was not insane as claimed by him.18) Another factor which goes against the appellant-accused is that he himself was examined as a defence witness No.3. According to learned trial Judge, as a witness, he made his statement clearly and cogently and it was also observed that he was meticulously following the court proceedings, acting suitably when the records were furnished for perusal. The trial Judge has also pointed out that during the entire proceedings, the accused has nowhere stated that he was insane earlier to the date of incident. The trial Judge, after noting his answers in respect of the questions under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has concluded that the accused could not be termed as an ""insane"" person.19) In the light of the above discussion and in view of the materials placed and the decision arrived at by the trial Court and of the fact that there is no evidence as to the unsoundness of mind of the appellant-accused at the time of the occurrence, namely, on 05.11.2001 and also taking note of the fact that the accused failed to discharge the burden as stated in Section 105 of the Evidence Act, we fully agree with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court.20) Consequently, the appeal fails and the same is dismissed..........................J.

4,"Palani Vs. State of Tamil Nadu[Criminal Appeal No._______ of 2024 @ SLP (Crl.) No. 256 of 2022]Sanjay Karol, J.1. Leave granted.2. This appeal arises out of an order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Madras dated 6th September 2021 in CRLRC No.413 of 2019, by which interference in the order of the Additional District & Sessions Judge, Tiruvallur1 dated 16th April, 2019 has been refused.The lower Appellate Court had modified the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate2 dated 23rd November 2018 in as much as it set aside the appellant's conviction under Section 18 (c) read with Section 27 (b)(ii) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 19403 while confirming the conviction and sentence in regard to Section 18(A) read with Section 28, of the said Act.3. A brief review of facts, as borne out by the judgments of the Courts below is necessary for adjudication of the instant dispute.3.1 One Palani4 ran a clinic which on 13th October, 2015 was inspected by the officials of the State, viz. The Pallippattu Range Drug Inspector; Joint Director, Tiruvallur District Health Department; Zone Drug Inspector Poonamallee.3.2 The inspection found 29 types of allopathic medicines meant for distribution without the proper paperwork (license) for sale. Moreover, upon being questioned as to the source of procurement of these medicines, details remained unfurnished.3.3 The Drug Inspector, Pallippattu filed a complaint under Section 200 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 under the Sections noted above. Prosecution was initiated on the basis of 6 witnesses; 12 Exhibits and with the 29 types of medicines (a small quantity5) recovered, being marked as material objects.3.4 Upon consideration of the evidence presented, the Trial Court found the case of the prosecution to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and, therefore, the Appellant was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 1,00,000/-. In default whereof, he was to undergo three months simple imprisonment for the offences under Section 18(c) read with Section 27(b)(ii). For the offence under Section 18A read with 28 of the Act, the sentence was six months simple imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 20,000/- with one-month simple imprisonment in default. Sentences awarded were concurrent in nature. Further, a cost of Rs.2500/- stood imposed for newspaper publication under Section 35 of the said Act.3.5 On appeal, the learned Additional District & Sessions Judge, i.e., the lower Appellate Court was faced primarily with the issue, of whether it has been proved that the drugs recovered were in the possession of the appellant for the purpose of sale/distribution.3.6 In deciding this question, the Court noted that no patients or any other persons were examined to establish that the drugs so confiscated were actually sold. No bills/receipts were produced. It was noted that PW5 as also PW3 testified to the fact that the Appellant was running a medical shop, but it was observed that no proof had been offered to show that the drugs in the clinic were for sale.The Court also relied on Ex. P-10 (letter of the accused to the Drug Inspector) referred to as A-10 in its judgment, to state that there is only admission of possession but none for sale/distribution. It was, therefore, observed that no evidence has been put forth by the complainant in regard to sale and/or distribution. The offence under Section 18 (c) of the Act was, therefore, not proven.3.7 The conviction and sentence in this regard was set aside while others were confirmed. Accordingly, it was held that the Appellant was entitled to a refund of Rs. 1,00,000/-.4. A criminal revision case stood filed against the judgment and order of the lower Appellate Court. It was observed that the scope of a Revisional Court is limited and is not akin to an Appellate Court. On account of the absence of any perversity or infirmity in the order of the lower Courts, the revision was dismissed. A further prayer was made to set aside the conviction and sentence under Section 18(A) of the Act and vice it, a fine could be imposed. The same was rejected.5. Hence, the present appeal.6. We have heard Mr. S. Nagamuthu, learned senior counsel and Mr. M.P. Parthiban, learned counsel for the appellant and Dr. Joseph Aristotle, learned senior counsel for the respondent-State.7. Before us, there is not a serious challenge to the conviction itself. However, it is submitted that the appellant, being a doctor, had no ill intention (mens rea) to contravene the law and undertake any action which may be scuttling the statutory provisions. It is as such prayed that the sentence of imprisonment be modified to that of a fine.8. A proper sentence, as has been observed by this Court in Mohammad Giassudin v. State of Andhra Pradesh6 is an amalgam of many factors pertaining to the offence itself as also others such as prior record if any, age, record of employment, education, home life, social adjustment and emotional and mental conditions of the offender etc.9. At present, the impugned judgment as it stands, convicts the Appellant under Section 18A read with Section 28 of the Act. Both these provisions concern the disclosure or non-disclosure respectively of the name of the manufacturer.The former stipulates a requirement for every person who is not a manufacturer or agent of distribution to disclose the name of the person from whom he has acquired such drug or cosmetic. The latter imposes a punishment for violation of the aforesaid requirement to the tune of imprisonment up to a year or with a fine not less than Rs.20,000/-, or with both.10. In the present case, the punishment imposed is six months simple imprisonment with the minimum statutory fine.11. It is not in dispute that the Appellant is a doctor. We notice that this Court in S. Athilakshmi v. State Rep. by The Drug Inspector7 had acquitted a doctor of stocking a small amount of drug as the same was not slated to be equal to selling medicines across the counter in a shop. This offence, as already noted above, was found not proved by the lower Appellate Court.12. The only aspect which remains is a non-disclosure of the name of the manufacturer. We find that the quantities of the 29 kinds of medicines recovered from the clinic run by the Appellant, were of small quantity.In such a situation, non-disclosure of the name of the manufacturer/person from whom the said medicines were acquired, cannot be said to be endangering public interest (which obviously, is the primary object of the prohibition in law) by allowing the circulation of such substances unauthorizedly.13. In the attending facts and circumstances, considering that the Appellant is a doctor and also keeping in view the observations of this Court in Mohammad Giassudin (supra), we are of the considered view that imposing a sentence of imprisonment would be unjustified, particularly when the intent to sell/distribute under Section 18(c) of the Act has been held unproven.Therefore, we find it fit to modify the impugned judgment, set aside the sentence of imprisonment as awarded, and instead thereof, impose a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- on the Appellant.14. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. The exemption from surrendering granted by this Court vide order dated 7th January, 2022 is made absolute. Pending application(s) if any, shall stand disposed of.......................J. (B.R. Gavai)......................J.

5,"William Stephen Vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr.[Criminal Appeal No. 607/2024][Criminal Appeal No. 608/2024]Abhay S. Oka, J.Facts1. These two Appeals have been preferred by the accused nos.2 and 1 respectively against the impugned judgment dated 27th July, 2016 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras, whereby their conviction and sentence have been confirmed. The appellants-accused have been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 364A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, ""IPC""). Both of them have been sentenced to undergo life imprisonment.2. With a view to appreciate the controversy, a brief reference to the factual aspects will be necessary. PW-1 and PW-3 are respectively the father and the mother of PW-2 (the child who is the victim of the offence). The age of the child-PW-2 at the relevant time was eight years. The child/PW-2 was taking education in third standard. After returning from the school, the child-PW-2 used to visit the house of PW-5, who was running tuition classes. The child-PW-2 used to return around 07:30 p.m.3. On 20th October, 2010, the child-PW-2 did not return from the tuition class at usual hour. The case of the prosecution is that after the tuition class was over, while the child-PW-2 was walking back towards his home, a Maruti Car came there. Two persons (appellants-accused) came out and told the child-PW-2 that his father was going to purchase a car from them and, therefore, he should accompany them. Accordingly, the child-PW-2 got into the car and was kidnapped by the appellants-accused.4. The case of the prosecution is that on 20th October, 2010, from a particular cell phone number, there was a call received by PW-3 of a male person who informed her that he has kidnapped the child. He demanded ransom of Rs.5 lakhs for releasing the child. The PW-1 lodged a complaint on the same date in the night with the Police. PW-14 (who was running a shop in the locality) informed the PW-1 and PW-3 that he saw the child being taken in a Maruti Swift grey colour car.Accordingly, a First Information Report under Section 364A of IPC was registered. PW-19 is the Investigating Officer. As per the information received, PW-19 went to Pallikonda toll gate, Vellore District on 21st October, 2010. Around 12:00 noon, the car in question came towards the toll gate which was intercepted. In the car, the appellants-accused along with the child were found. PW-19 arrested the accused and rescued the child.5. The prosecution evidence, as can be seen from both the judgments, was in the form of the call records and the evidence of PW-1 to PW-3 and PW-19, the Investigating Officer. As far as the call records are concerned, we find that the entire evidence of the prosecution has been discarded by the High Court for want of a certificate as required under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (for short, ""the Evidence Act"").Submissions6. The learned senior counsel appearing for both the appellants have taken us through the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. Their submission is that there is absolutely no evidence regarding the demand of ransom or any threat being administered by the appellants-accused to kill the child or to put him to some harm.Therefore, the necessary ingredients of Section 364A of IPC have not been proved. By inviting our attention to the evidence of the child, who is PW-2, and, in particular, his cross-examination by the learned counsel representing the accused no.2, the learned senior counsel contended that the victim child was tutored by his father-PW-1 and, therefore, his testimony cannot be considered.7. The learned senior counsel appearing for the State submitted that this was a case where there was a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the PW-1 and PW-3 that the accused, who had kidnapped their son, may put their son to death or cause hurt to him. He would, therefore, submit that on the basis of the evidence of PW-1 and PW-3, the ingredients of Section 364A of IPC have been proved by the prosecution.Our View8. We have carefully considered the submissions. Firstly, we may refer to Section 361 of IPC which defines 'kidnapping from lawful guardianship'. It provides that whoever takes or entices any minor male child under sixteen years of age, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor, without the consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such minor or person from lawful guardianship. In this case, there is no dispute about the lawful guardianship of PW-1 and PW-3. The kidnapping from lawful guardianship is made punishable under Section 363 of IPC and the maximum punishment is imprisonment of either description which may extend to seven years.9. Now, we turn to Section 364A of IPC which reads thus:""364a. Kidnapping for Ransom, Etc.-Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person or keeps a person in detention after such kidnapping or abduction, and threatens to cause death or hurt to such person, or by his conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that such person may be put to death or hurt, or causes hurt or death to such person in order to compel the Government or any foreign State or international inter-governmental organisation or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a ransom, shall be punishable with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.""10. The first ingredient of Section 364A is that there should be a kidnapping or abduction of any person or a person should be kept in detention after such kidnapping or abduction. If the said act is coupled with a threat to cause death or hurt to such person, an offence under Section 364A is attracted. If the first act of kidnapping or abduction of a person or keeping him in detention after such kidnapping is coupled with such conduct of the person kidnapping which gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that the kidnapped or abducted person may be put to death or hurt, still Section 364A will be attracted. In the light of this legal position, now we refer to the evidence of the child-PW-2.11. We have carefully perused the evidence of the child-PW-2, who is the victim of the offence. At the relevant time, the age of the child was eight years. In the examination-in-chief, he has given vivid account of what exactly transpired at the time of the incident. He stated thus:""I had been getting back home around 07.00 'O' Clock at night, after attending the tuition, as usual. A Swift Car, in grey shade, bearing Reg.No.TN 05 V 7290, gave a halt by my side. There were two persons on board. They summoned me, stating that my father is going to buy a car. They took me on board. They sought the phone number of my father. I gave them my father's phone number 98840 49011.They asked my mother's number. I gave them my mother's phone number 98402 58273. Subsequently, I fell asleep in the car. When I got up in the morning, I found the car in a check post. The police got them napped. The persons who took me in the car as such are the accused who are present before this Court. The car is marked as M.O.1. The police questioned me. I have recounted the turn of events.""12. We have carefully perused the cross-examination. On the main incident, his version has not been shaken in the cross-examination. It is true that in response to the questions put to him in the cross-examination by the Advocate appearing for the accused no.2, the child-PW-2 deposed that his father-PW-1 taught him the particulars which need to be reproduced in the Court and that he has recounted the particulars taught by his father before the Court.13. We find from the cross-examination of the child-PW-2 that there is hardly any challenge to the main incident. In fact, a suggestion was given to him that the men who had taken him in the car are the ones who were acquaintance with him and his father. This is the defence as reflected from the cross-examination.14. It is not brought on record by the accused that there was a prior enmity or animosity between the parents of the victim child and the accused. There was no reason for the father of the victim to falsely implicate the appellants and tutor the child to depose against them. Therefore, the case sought to be made out that the child was tutored by his father was not rightly accepted by the Courts below. Therefore, it can be said that the 'kidnapping' within the meaning of Section 361 of IPC was established by the prosecution. Hence, the appellants are guilty of the offence punishable under Section 363 of IPC.15. The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants were at pains to point out inconsistent versions of PW-1 and PW-3 about who received the phone call demanding ransom. However, this issue need not detain us. The details of the phone call records were produced by the Police. It is an admitted position that the Police could not trace the name of the person who was holding the cell phone number stated by both, the PW-1 and PW-3, in their examination-in-chief. Their version is that they received the call demanding ransom from the said number.The record relating to the call details has been discarded by the High Court as there was no certification under Section 65B of the Evidence Act. The call records could have been the best possible evidence for the prosecution to prove the threats allegedly administered by the accused and the demand of ransom. Even taking the evidence of PW-1 and PW-3 as correct, all that is proved is that they received a phone call from someone for demanding ransom and the person threatened to kill their son in case ransom is not paid.However, the prosecution is not able to connect the alleged demand and the threat with both the accused. Therefore, the ingredients of Section 364A of IPC were not proved by the prosecution inasmuch as the prosecution failed to lead cogent evidence to establish the second part of Section 364A about the threats given by the accused to cause death or hurt to such person.In a given case, if the threats given to the parents or the close relatives of the kidnapped person by the accused are established, then a case can be made out that there was a reasonable apprehension that the person kidnapped may be put to death or hurt may be caused to him. However, in this case, the demand and threat by the accused have not been established by the prosecution.16. Therefore, the only conclusion is that the conviction of the appellants for the offence punishable under Section 364A of IPC will have to be set aside. However, there will be a conviction for the lesser offence of kidnapping defined by Section 361 of IPC, which is punishable under Section 363 of IPC.It is not in dispute that the appellants have undergone actual incarceration for a period of more than eight years. The maximum sentence for the offences punishable under Section 363 of IPC extends to seven years with fine. The appellants have undergone more than the maximum sentence prescribed.17. Before we part with the judgment, we must note here that the PW-19, the Investigating Officer, was not aware of the procedure to be followed for obtaining a certificate under Section 65B of the Evidence Act. He cannot be blamed as a proper training was not imparted to him. The State Government must ensure that the Police Officers are imparted proper training on this aspect.18. Therefore, the Appeals are partly allowed and the conviction and sentence of the appellants for the offence punishable under Section 364A of IPC is hereby quashed and set aside and it is held that the appellants are guilty of the offence punishable under Section 363 of IPC.As the appellants are in custody and as they have undergone maximum sentence for the offence punishable under Section 363 of IPC, we direct that they shall be forthwith set at liberty......................J.

6,"Vedanta Ltd. Vs. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.[Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos. 10159-10168 of 2020][Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos. 10461-10462 of 2020][Civil Appeal Nos. 276-285 of 2021]Table of ContentsA. SLP (C) Nos 10159-10168 and 10461-10462 of 2020i. Background1. The Special Leave Petitions arise from a judgment dated 18 August 2020 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras in a batch of ten petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.2. A series of orders passed in April and May 2018 by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board1 and by the Government of Tamil Nadu and an order dated 29 March 2013 passed by the former form the subject of the challenge.3. By the orders impugned, the copper smelter operated by the petitioner (Vedanta Limited) at the SIPCOT industrial complex in Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu was directed to be closed for violations of numerous environmental norms.4. Initially, there was a challenge before the National Green Tribunal. The order of the Tribunal was placed in issue before this Court by the TNPCB and became the subject matter of a judgment delivered by this Court on 18 February 2019, reported as Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board v. Sterlite Industries (India) Limited.2 While coming to the conclusion that there was an absence of jurisdiction on the part of the National Green Tribunal, this Court granted liberty to the operator of the unit to move the High Court in appropriate proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution.5. This resulted in the institution of the petitions before the High Court, as noticed above, and the judgment of the High Court which has been questioned in these proceedings.ii. The judgment of this Court in 20136. An earlier judgment of this Court, reported as Sterlite Industries (India) Limited v. Union of India,3 concerned the same unit as in the present proceedings. Environmental clearances were granted to the unit in 1995 and it commenced production in 1997. Separate writ petitions were instituted before the High Court, inter alia for directions to cancel the environmental clearances; close the operation of the unit; and to the state to take action against the unit for its failure to take safety measures to remedy pollution and to protect against industrial accidents. By an order dated 28 September 2010, the High Court allowed the writ petitions and directed that the unit be closed. On appeal, a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Sterlite Industries (supra) adjudicated the validity of this order. This Court held that:a. The High Court was not justified in interfering with the decision to grant environmental clearance on the ground of procedural impropriety;b. The High Court was not justified in directing the closure of the plant on the ground that it was located in the SIPCOT industrial complex which was within a 25 km radius of four ecologically sensitive islands in the Gulf of Mannar. This is because one of the consent orders permitted the establishment of the 3(2013) 4 SCC 575. plant at this location. However, the possibility of shifting the plant in the future was not precluded, if it became necessary for the purpose of conserving the environment;c. The High Court ought not to have interfered with the exercise of power by the TNPCB, which reduced the width of the mandated green belt in the noobjection certificate;d. Article 21 of the Constitution empowered the High Court to direct the plant to be closed if it was found to be polluting the environment, notwithstanding the fact that environmental clearances had been granted. This could be done if no other remedial measure was available; and e. Inspections of the unit indicated that some emissions and effluents were beyond the permissible limit prescribed by TNPCB. The unit was polluting the environment in violation of legal norms (detailed in the following paragraphs).7. In terms of the directions of this Court, TNPCB issued directions for the removal of deficiencies. It was then claimed on behalf of the unit that the deficiencies had been removed. On the basis of a joint inspection by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute4 and the Central Pollution Control Board,5 this Court found that several suggestions towards remediation had been complied with.This Court was of the view that closure was therefore not the only remedy. Though there was a suppression of fact by the unit, the Court was not inclined to order closure at that stage and imposed instead a requirement of compensation quantified at Rs. 100 crores for non-compliance with environmental parameters and operating without consent in terms of the applicable environmental law:""47. we are of the view that the appellant Company should be held liable for a compensation of Rs 100 crores for having polluted the environment in the vicinity of its plant and for having operated the plant without a renewal of the consents by the TNPCB for a fairly long period and according to us, any less amount, would not have the desired deterrent effect on the appellant Company.""8. While setting aside the order of closure, this Court nonetheless observed that its judgment would not prevent TNPCB from issuing directions to the unit including a direction for closure, if required.iii. The decision in this casea. Violations of environmental norms and consequent harm9. Before assessing the submissions of the parties, it is necessary to understand the basis for the decision of the High Court as well of this Court in 2013. It is not possible for this Court to assess the merits of the submissions, shorn of the context in which the decision(s) were rendered. Both this Court in Sterlite Industries (supra) as well as the High Court in the impugned judgment found that the unit of the petitioner was guilty of serious violations of environmental and other laws.10. In 2013, this Court in Sterlite Industries (supra) found that the unit had violated the law in more than one way:a. The unit had caused pollution between 1997 and 2012;b. The reports of NEERI indicated non-compliance with environmental standards;c. The unit had operated without a renewal of the consent to operate for a long period of time; andd. There was an act of suppression and misrepresentation on the part of the unit in the proceedings before this Court.11. In the impugned judgment, the High Court inter alia found that:a. The unit had operated without consent from TNPCB for about sixteen years;b. The unit had operated without hazardous waste management authorisation for about ten years;c. The unit did not have appropriate systems in place for the disposal of hazardous waste;d. There was a substantial presence of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the water;e. The unit dumped large amounts of copper slag, leading to air and water pollution. The dumped copper slag also caused the river in Thootukudi to flood. This was a violation of the conditions in terms of which the relevant authorities had granted consent;f. The unit failed to comply with the requirement of maintaining a green belt;g. The regulator, TNPCB, did not exercise its powers in a timely and effective fashion, as mandated by law; andh. TNPCB established that the unit flouted the law for over twenty-two years. There was no error in the decision of the authorities to direct the closure of the unit.12. This Court must have due regard to these findings of fact and law while adjudicating whether grounds for interference with the impugned judgment are made out.b. The High Court did not commit an error of jurisdiction13. Essentially, five grounds were urged in the orders for the closure of the unit. They are:a. The unit had failed to furnish ground water examination reports to ascertain the impact on ground water quality;b. An extensive amount of copper slag lying on third party land had not been removed. A physical barrier had not been constructed between the copper slag and the river to prevent the slag from reaching the river;c. The unit had applied for authorization to generate and dispose of hazardous waste but did not have an extant licence;d. There was a failure to measure emissions in terms of the National Air Quality Ambient Standards; ande. The requirement of a gypsum pond (mandated by guidelines issued by CPCB) had not been observed.14. Apart from the merits, the principal submission which has been urged on behalf of the petitioner by Mr Shyam Divan, senior counsel (supported by Mr Krishnan Venugopal, senior counsel) is that since the closure was founded on the above five grounds, the High Court was not justified, while exercising its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, in enquiring into other grounds of environmental violations.15. The above submission has been opposed both by Mr CS Vaidyanathan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the TNPCB and Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu. They have submitted, on the basis of the reliefs which were sought in the writ proceedings, that the petitioners had not merely challenged the orders adverse to them but had, in addition, sought a mandamus for the issuance of renewal permissions. Hence, it was urged that in such an event, it was open to the High Court not only to enquire into the grounds on which closure had been directed but to determine whether the petitioner was entitled to a renewal of permissions.16. From a reading of the judgment of the High Court, it has emerged that the petitioner had expressly consented to the High Court enquiring into all the facets of the matter so as to determine fully and finally as to whether the petitioner would be entitled to a renewal of the permissions which were granted to it. Otherwise, even if the orders impugned were to be set aside, both the Board and the Government would have been justified in requesting the High Court to remand the proceedings back to the competent statutory authorities for re-determination afresh. This course of action was obviated on the petitioner submitting to the High Court that it was ready and willing to have the High Court evaluate the entirety of the matter in its full perspective.17. The petitioner having agreed to this course of action, we are not inclined to entertain the submission that the High Court has committed an error of jurisdiction. The hearing before the High Court spanned forty-two days and the High Court has rendered a judgment on all factual and legal aspects, after considering as many as thirty-eight issues.c. Interference under Article 136 is not warranted18. In considering the merits of the challenge, this Court would have to apply settled principles of judicial review bearing on whether the findings which have been arrived at by the High Court are borne out from the record or conversely, are based on misappreciation of law and fact. This Court may exercise its power under Article 136 sparingly and only when exceptional circumstances exist which justify the exercise of its discretion.619. From the material which has emerged on the record and having considered the rival submissions, we are of the view that the areas which are matters of serious concern are:a. The failure of the petitioner at the material time to remove the copper slag which was dumped indiscriminately at almost eleven sites in the vicinity including private land adjoining the river;b. The failure to abide by the conditions in the 'consent to operate' governing the disposal of gypsum;c. The failure to obtain authorisation for the disposal of hazardous waste; andd. The failure of the petitioner to continue remediating the pollution caused by it despite findings and directions by multiple judicial fora at different points in time, including by this Court in 2013.20. The judgment of this Court in Sterlite Industries (supra) afforded the petitioner sufficient opportunity to take remedial action. The consequence of the adjudication by this Court was not to obliterate the environmental violations which had preceded it. This Court came to the conclusion that there indeed were environmental violations, which were additionally compounded by a suppression of material facts. As the court held:""48. We now come to the submission of Mr Prakash that we should not grant relief to the appellants because of the misrepresentation and suppression of material facts made in the special leave petition that the appellants have always been running their plant with statutory consents and approvals and misrepresentation and suppression of material facts made in the special leave petition that the plant was closed at the time the special leave petition was moved and a stay order was obtained from this Court.There is no doubt that there has been misrepresentation and suppression of material facts made in the special leave petition but to decline relief to the appellants in this case would mean closure of the plant of the appellants. For these considerations of public interest, we do not think it will be a proper exercise of our discretion under Article 136 of the Constitution to refuse relief on the grounds of misrepresentation and suppression of material facts in the special leave petition.""(emphasis supplied)21. The Court in the earlier round of litigation would conceivably have been justified in rejecting the challenge to the judgment of the High Court but nonetheless held that closure was a matter of last option and that an opportunity for remediation ought to be granted. At the same time, while imposing an environmental compensation quantified at Rs. 100 crores, this Court clarified that TNPCB would be acting within the scope of its statutory powers including in directing closure, in the future. As the Court held:""50. we make it clear that this judgment will not stand in the way of the TNPCB issuing directions to the appellant Company, including a direction for closure of the plant, for the protection of environment in accordance with law.51. We also make it clear that the award of damages of Rs 100 crores by this judgment against the appellant Company for the period from 1997 to 2012 will not stand in the way of any claim for damages for the aforesaid period or any other period in a civil court or any other forum in accordance with law.""722. The tenor of the reasoning and the directions of this Court, therefore, leave no manner of doubt that the industrial establishment was not exculpated of its liability for environmental violations. The High Court has, in this backdrop, undertaken a copious analysis of the grounds on which action adverse to the unit has been taken both by the TNPCB and the State Government.23. In the notes of submissions which have been tendered before this Court, an alternative perspective on facts has been sought to be established. We are not inclined in the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution to re-appreciate the findings of facts which have been arrived at by the High Court. The High Court, it must be noted, was exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution to judicially review the findings of statutory authorities and bodies entrusted with requisite powers under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution Act) 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981.Apart from the exercise of jurisdiction by the statutory authorities, the proceedings before this Court had been preceded by an evaluation by the High Court which is not shown to suffer from error that would warrant the invocation of the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution. No special circumstances exist which justify the exercise of discretion by this Court nor is the conscience of the Court shocked by the judgment of the High Court.24. The closure of the industry is undoubtedly not a matter of first choice. The nature of the violations and the repeated nature of the breaches coupled with the severity of the breach of environmental norms would in the ultimate analysis have left neither the statutory authorities nor the High Court with the option to take any other view unless they were to be oblivious of their plain duty. We are conscious of the fact that the unit, as this Court observed in its decision in 2013, has been contributing to the productive assets of the nation and providing employment and revenue in the area.While these aspects have undoubted relevance, the Court has to be mindful of other well-settled principles including the principles of sustainable development, the polluter pays principle, and the public trust doctrine. The polluter pays principle, a widely accepted norm in international and domestic environmental law, asserts that those who pollute or degrade the environment should bear the costs of mitigation and restoration. This principle serves as a reminder that economic activities should not come at the expense of environmental degradation or the health of the population.25. In addition, the public trust doctrine, recognized in various jurisdictions, including India, establishes that the state holds natural resources in trust for the benefit of the public. It reinforces the idea that the State must act as a steward of the environment, ensuring that the common resources necessary for the well-being of the populace are protected against exploitation or degradation.These principles underscore the importance of balancing economic interests with environmental and public welfare concerns. While the industry has played a role in economic growth, the health and welfare of the residents of the area is a matter of utmost concern. In the ultimate analysis, the State Government is responsible for preserving and protecting their concerns.26. As consistently held in numerous decisions of this Court, the unequivocal right to a clean environment is an indispensable entitlement extended to all persons.8 Air, which is polluted beyond the permissible limit, not only has a detrimental impact on all life forms including humans, but also triggers a cascade of ecological ramifications. The same is true for polluted water, where the pervasive contamination poses a profound threat to the delicate balance of ecosystems.The impact of environmental pollution and degradation is far reaching : it is often not only severe but also persists over the long term. While some adverse effects may be immediately evident, the intensity of other kinds of harm reveals itself over time. Persons who live in surrounding areas may develop diseases which not only result in financial burdens but also impact the quality of life.The development and growth of children in these communities may become stunted, creating a tragic legacy of compromised potential. Basic necessities, such as access to potable water, may not be met, exacerbating the challenges faced by these already vulnerable populations. Undoubtedly, such adverse effects are felt more deeply by marginalised and poor communities, for whom it becomes increasingly difficult to escape the cycle of poverty.27. This Court is also alive to the concept of intergenerational equity,9 which suggests that ""present residents of the earth hold the earth in trust for future generations and at the same time the present generation is entitled to reap benefits from it.""10 The planet and its invaluable resources must be conscientiously conserved and responsibly managed for the use and enjoyment of future generations, emphasising the enduring obligation to safeguard the environmental heritage for the well-being of all.28. It is an undeniable and fundamental truth that all persons have the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, live a life free from disease and sickness, and for those who till the earth, have access to uncontaminated soil. These rights are not only recognized as essential components of human rights but are also enshrined in various international treaties and agreements, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Paris Agreement.As such, they must be protected and upheld by governments and institutions worldwide, even as we generate employment and industry. The ultimate aim of all our endeavours is for all people to be able to live 'the good life.' Without these basic rights, increased revenue and employment cease to have any real meaning.It is not merely about economic growth but about ensuring the well-being and dignity of every individual. As we pursue development, we must prioritize the protection of these rights, recognizing that they are essential for sustainable progress. Only by safeguarding these fundamental rights can we truly create a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and prosper.29. We have heard these proceedings for several days and after a careful evaluation of the factual and legal material, we have come to the conclusion that the Special Leave Petitions do not warrant interference under Article 136 of the Constitution.30. For the above reasons, the Special Leave Petitions shall stand dismissed.31. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.B. Civil Appeal Nos. 276-285 of 202132. TNPCB is aggrieved by the observations contained in the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 18 August 2020 about its failure to exercise its regulatory functions in a timely and conscientious manner and has preferred appeals in this regard.We are of the view that the High Court was justified in making the observations in regard to the lack of alacrity on the part of the Pollution Control Board in discharging its duties. The observations of the High Court do not call to be either expunged or obliterated from the record.33. The Civil Appeals are accordingly dismissed.34.

7,"Government of Tamil Nadu & Ors. Vs. R. Thamaraiselvam Etc.[Civil Appeal Nos. 1580-1608 of 2022][Criminal Appeal No. 275 of 2022]M.R. Shah, J.1. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common judgment and order dated 10.02.2015 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ Petition No. 18872/2011 and other allied writ petitions, by which the High Court has allowed the said writ petitions and has quashed G.O. (Ms.) No. 423, Home (Police XI) Department dated 28.07.2011 (hereinafter referred to as 'G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011') as well as G.O.(Ms.) No. 451, Home (Court III) Department dated 11.08.2011 (hereinafter referred to as 'G.O. No. 451 dated 11.08.2011'), the State of Tamil Nadu has preferred the present appeals.1.1 Criminal Appeal No. 275/2022 has been preferred challenging the impugned order dated 04.11.2020 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Criminal O.P. No. 23641/2019, by which the High Court has directed to transfer the case being C.C. No. 2 of 2012 from the Court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Land Grabbing, Erode to the file of Judicial Magistrate-II, Erode.2. Vide G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011, the State of Tamil Nadu sanctioned formation of 36 Anti Land Grabbing Special Cells in Tamil Nadu with one cell each at the State Police Headquarters, 7 Commissionerates and 28 Districts to deal with the Land Grabbing Cases in the State. Consequent upon the said G.O., another G.O. bearing No. 451 dated 11.08.2011 came to be issued and the Land Grabbing Cases were ordered to be transferred to the Special Courts which were constituted exclusively to deal with the Land Grabbing Cases. The aforesaid G.Os were the subject matter of the writ petitions before the High Court.2.1 By the impugned common judgment and order, the High Court has set aside G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011 by holding that the same does not lay down any yardstick or guideline to pick and choose and select particular cases against particular persons said to have indulged in land grabbing and in the absence of definition of the word/phrase ""Land Grabbing"", discretion is vested with the police personnel attached to the Anti-Land Grabbing Cell to pick and choose against whom they want to register FIR and proceed with the investigation and on account of the same, the possibility of abuse and misuse of power cannot be ruled out.While quashing and setting aside G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011, the High Court has also observed that the State Government is at liberty to bring any appropriate legislation along the lines of the A.P. Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 or better legislations de hors the result of the writ petitions. Consequently, the High Court has also quashed and set aside G.O. No. 451 dated 11.08.2011. The impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court is the subject matter of present Civil Appeals.3. Shri R. Shunmugasundaram, learned Advocate General has appeared on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu.3.1 Learned Advocate General appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu has vehemently submitted that the High Court has erred in quashing the Government Orders by holding that in the absence of definition pertaining to offence of ""Land Grabbing"", the Special Cells constituted for investigating the cases pertaining to land grabbing are not competent to investigate those kind of cases.3.2 It is further submitted that the High Court has erred in quashing and setting aside G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011 on the possibility of abuse and misuse of power by the police officers. That the possibility of abuse or misuse of a provision by the authority cannot be a ground for a legislation to be held to be arbitrary or violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.3.3 It is next submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the Special Cells were constituted to deal with the specific problem in the State of Tamil Nadu where large number of complaints are being filed alleging that goondas by using their muscle power have forcibly occupied lands.3.4 It is contended that the High Court ought to have appreciated that the expression ""Land Grabbing"" does not need any specific definition as the said expression relates to Sections 447, 420 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code.4. We have heard learned Advocate General on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu at length. We have gone through the common impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. We have also gone through G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011, which reads as under:""HOME (POL-XI) DEPARTMENTDated: 28.07.2011From the Director General of Police, Chennai - 4,letter Re: No.:176388/RA I (2)/2011, dated : 13.07.2011ORDER:-In the Press Release dated: 10.07.2011, the Hon'ble Chief Minister has made an announcement that Anti Land Grabbing Special Cells will be formed in Tamilnadu to deal with the Land grabbing cases in the State.2.

  RAMESHRAM MISHRA
  PRINCIPAL SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT""5. By the aforesaid G.O., the Government of Tamil Nadu has constituted/formed 36 Anti Land Grabbing Special Cells to deal with the land grabbing cases. However, it is required to be noted that the type of cases can be said to be land grabbing cases has not been defined and/or mentioned in the said G.O.Therefore, it will be at the discretion of the concerned police officers to treat and/or consider any case relating to land as land grabbing case, which shall be investigated by the Anti- Land Grabbing Special Cell, rather than by the police officers under the Cr.P.C. It is required to be noted that as such there is no Anti-Land Grabbing Act in the State of Tamil Nadu like A.P. Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 or Karnataka Land Grabbing Prohibition Act, 2011 or similar Land Grabbing Prohibition Acts in other States.It is required to be noted that in the other Land Grabbing Prohibition Acts applicable in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Assam, ""Land Grabbing"" is specifically defined. Even the term ""Land Grabber"" is defined. For example, in Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982, ""Land Grabber"" and ""Land Grabbing"" are defined as under:""land grabber"" means a person or a group of persons who commits land grabbing and includes any person who gives financial aid to any person for taking illegal possession of lands or for construction of unauthorised structures thereon, or who collects or attempts to collect from any occupiers of such lands rent, compensation and other charges by criminal intimidation, or who abets the doing of any of the above mentioned acts; and also includes the successors in interest.""land grabbing"" means every activity of grabbing of any land (whether belonging to the government, a local authority, a religious or charitable institution or endowment, including a wakf, or any other private person) by a person or group of persons, without any lawful entitlement and with a view to illegally taking possession of such lands, or enter into or create illegal tenancies or lease and licences agreements or any other illegal agreements in respect of such lands, or to construct unauthorised structures thereon for sale or hire, or give such lands to any person on rental or lease and licence basis for construction, or use and occupation, of unauthorised structures; and the term ""to grab and"" shall be construed accordingly.6. Insofar as the State of Tamil Nadu is concerned, it is an admitted position that there is no specific enactment and/or Act to deal with land grabbing cases, like Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 and the Anti-Land Grabbing Special Cells have been formed by G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011 to exclusively deal with the land grabbing cases.In absence of any guidelines and/or definition as to which cases can be said to be land grabbing cases, it gives unfettered and unguided and arbitrary powers to the police to treat any land case as a land grabbing case which will be investigated by the Anti- Land Grabbing Special Cell.Even a dispute between two private persons which may be under the Specific Relief Act and/or Transfer of Property Act may be considered as a land grabbing case like in Criminal Appeal No. 275/2022 in which a Civil Suit was pending for specific performance which was dismissed for non-prosecution and thereafter the defendant filed a complaint/FIR for the offences under the IPC.Therefore, as such, it is rightly held and observed by the High Court that in absence of any specific guideline and/or definition of ""land grabbing cases,"" such powers can be abused or misused and such powers can be said to be exercised arbitrarily. Therefore, the High Court has rightly set aside G.O. No. 423 dated 28.07.2011 with liberty to the State Government to bring any appropriate legislation on the lines of A.P.Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 or better legislations after defining and/or providing the guidelines as to which offences can be said to be ""land grabbing cases"". Therefore, the impugned judgment(s) and order(s) passed by the High Court does/do not call for any interference by this Court.7. Under the circumstances, Civil Appeals preferred by the State deserve to be dismissed and are accordingly dismissed.However, we reiterate that if the State Government is so conscious and/or interested in taking action against land grabbers, it will be open for the State Government to bring an appropriate legislation with the clear definition of ""land grabber"" and ""land grabbing"" or better legislations with a clear definition of ""land grabbing"", ""land grabber"" and ""land grabbing cases"" and the present order shall not come in their way to enact such legislation and/or better legislations.8. In view of the above, Criminal Appeal No. 275/2022 which was with respect to private persons by which the Criminal case between the parties is ordered to be transferred to the regular Court from the Special Court (Land Grabbing) deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed.........................J.

8,"Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Paper cup Manufactures Association Vs. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.[Civil Appeal No. 8536 of 2022][Civil Appeal No(S). 8537-8538 of 2022]S. Ravindra Bhat, J.1. These appeals were heard finally, with the consent of the parties. The appellants are aggrieved by a common judgment1 of the Madras High Court, by which their writ petitions challenging a government order2 banning manufacture, storage, supply, transport, sale, distribution, and use of 'one time use and throwaway plastics', was dismissed. The appellants before this court are an association representing manufacturing units involved in the manufacture of 'reinforced' paper cups, and a manufacturer of non-woven plastic bags, respectively.Facts2. The Environment and Forest Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu issued the Government Order in question, in exercise of its power under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 ('EPA') on 25.06.2018 and it was to take effect from 01.01.2019. The Government Order included directions, banning manufacture, storage, supply, transport, sale, distribution, or use of ""use and throwaway plastics"" - which as per Explanation 2, included plastic carry bags, plastic flags, plastic sheets used for food wrapping, spreading on dining table, etc. plastic plates, ""plastic coated teacups"" and plastic tumbler, water pouches and packets, and plastic straws, regardless of thickness. Pertinently, non-woven bags were not expressly mentioned until a clarification dated 08.12.2018 issued by the state government, brought them within the scope of the ban.3. The directions also contained exemptions for plastic carry bags produced exclusively for export purposes by an industry in an SEZ or EOU; plastic bags which constitute or form an integral part of packaging in which goods are sealed prior to use at manufacturing/processing units; plastic bags and sheets used in forestry and horticulture nurseries against the orders from the government departments; plastic used for packing dairy products, oil, medicine, and medical equipment; and carry bags made of ""compostable plastics""3 (as per regulations).4 Pursuant to the Government Order, a Steering Committee headed by the Chief Secretary of the Government of Tamil Nadu, was constituted to monitor and implement the Notification.4. The appellant paper cup association made a representation on 05.09.2018 to the Government to reconsider and exclude them from the ban. Pursuant to this, an Expert Committee was constituted on 25.09.2018 to study and furnish a report on the compostable properties of paper cups and compostable plastics. The Expert Committee discussed the properties of LDPE coated paper cups, and alternative bioplastics which were biodegradable. It concluded that the LDPE made such cups non-biodegradable, but recyclable. However, due to insufficient collection mechanism or failure on the part of extended producer responsibility - they are not being recycled.5. The petitioner association was also invited for a personal hearing on 14.11.2018, during which they contended that the use of reinforced papercups had not been banned in other states (such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Orissa) which had also implemented a 'plastic ban'. The association's representation was rejected on 08.12.2018 by the TNPCB on two grounds: firstly, that this policy to ban one time use and throwaway plastics was to safeguard the environment in light of the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 (hereafter '2016 Rules'); and secondly, that the Expert Committee had concluded that the composition of the product, madee it difficult to degrade under natural environmental conditions.6. Similarly, the non-woven bag association also made representations on 23.08.2018 and 19.09.2018 to the TNPCB, which were rejected on similar grounds on 08.12.20185 through a clarification issued by TNPCB and a further detailed clarification issued by the State Government, that such non-woven bags were also banned. The reasoning given was that such bags are made of polypropylene, and do not degrade easily in natural environment.7. Aggrieved by the ban, the paper cup association challenged the Notification before the NGT which was dismissed6 on the ground that the challenge was not maintainable before the NGT.8. Approaching the High Court in its writ jurisdiction, the appellants cited their rights under Article 14, and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Their principal grounds were: firstly, that the reports relied upon by the State recognised that the paper cups were recyclable provided the paper and LDPE plastic layer were separated (which the association was willing to assist/support), and this product was not on the same footing as other plastic products banned.It was also emphasised that this action was taken without application of mind and would have a vast economic impact on the livelihood of 5-6 lakhs of employees. Secondly, that the mandatory consultative mechanism captured in Rule 4 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 (hereafter '1986 Rules') - of publishing a draft notification, inviting objections and passing a final notification after considering these - was not followed.9. Arguments on behalf of the non-woven bag industry were that these bags were water and air permeable, and hence did not choke drains. They were ecofriendly alternatives that could be used more than 10 times and were recyclable; they had not been banned anywhere else in the world and had wide usage and application.10. The High Court heard the writs along with various petitions filed by other aggrieved manufacturers from the plastic industries, and dismissed them by common judgment, upholding the ban.7 It agreed with other courts (namely, the Delhi High Court, Madhya Pradesh Court8, NGT9) as having rightly upheld the State's competence to pass such government orders under Section 5 of the EPA, in furtherance of its policy decision; judicial review of which, was limited.10On the question of non-woven bags, the court held that since they were non-biodegradable, their reusability carried the risk of pathogenic transmission, and the bags have tendency to cause reduction in rainfall infiltration and ground water discharge, there was no basis to conclude they were eco-friendly carry bag alternatives; the State had pursuant to a CIPET study, banned them.Given that the court is not scientific experts to determine the rival contentions of the parties, deference had to be paid to the decision of experts more familiar with the material11 and this could not be gone into in the writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. With regards to cups, it was noted that they are indiscriminately used and thrown after single use, accumulating in huge quantities, and causing an eye sore; since they squarely fall within 'one time use and throw' plastics, the ban was justified.11. The appellants seek this court's intervention on the ground that the common judgment was passed without considering the specific contentions made by them, and the product(s) in question.Appellants' contentions12. Counsel appearing for the appellant-association urged that reinforced paper cups (referred to as ""plastic coated teacups"" in the impugned notification) were an eco-friendly alternative to plastic cups owing to their composition of 94% food grade paper and only 6% coating of LDPE which is necessary to reinforce the cup and make it water resistant. Once the paper and plastic are separated, the paper is both recyclable and biodegradable while the LDPE is recyclable and reusable for different purposes. It was pointed out that the manufacturers in the MSME sector purchase the paper with the LDPE coating from paper mills like TNPL, ITC, etc. and use them to make the cups.13. The appellant's submissions were primarily on two planks - firstly that there was no scientific basis for the ban, which created an arbitrary classification; and secondly, that there was non-compliance with the 1986 Rules, which mandate publishing of draft rules and inviting objections, before passing an order such as the impugned notification. Counsel contended that the classification - of including paper cups with LDPE coating with other products that are largely composed of plastic - was arbitrary, and unjust. It was further highlighted that the products exempted under the notification are in fact, far more harmful to the environment which the High Court too, took note of.14. Addressing the three reports relied on by the State - counsel appearing for the appellant pointed out that none of these three reports, recommended a ban on reinforced paper cups. In fact the IIT Report recommended the use of paper cups as an alternative to plastic cups; the Expert Committee Report specifically noted that the LDPE coating on the paper cups can be separated in the pulping and screening process in paper mills, which it was urged is a common practice leading to both resultant paper and LDPE that is recyclable and reusable for different purposes; and that while the CIPET report elaborates on the physical characteristics of paper cups, there is no finding that it 'poses a threat to the environment' as concluded by the High Court erroneously.15. Counsel laboured on the failure of conducting prior consultation before issuing delegated legislation. Emphasis was placed on Rule 4 of the Environment Protection Rules, 1986, as being a mandatory requirement, rather than directory in nature. Therefore, the state had to have issued a draft or proposed notification, with a period of at least 15 days to make a reply to the same, followed by the issuance of a written order dealing with the objections raised. Reliance was placed on this Court's judgment in Cellular Operators Association of India & Ors., v. TRAI12.16. Counsel submitted that the High Court had proceeded on a misconceived notion on the 'degradability' of the cups. The question, however, is of 'recyclability' instead. That paper and LDPE coating can be separated in paper mills, is not in contention; the absence of a collection mechanism was the problem for which a total ban was a disproportionate solution.Citing Rule 6 of the Plastic Waste (Management & Handling) Rules 2016, the responsibility of creating and putting in place a collection mechanism was placed on the municipal corporations. The failure to do so, cannot impede the appellants' right to carry out its business. Without conceding their case, counsel expressed the appellants' willingness to cooperate with the authorities to improve the collection mechanism including through a buyback scheme of used cups.17. Lastly, counsel submitted that there is a large-scale reliance on and usage of disposable cups by the State of Tamil Nadu and its residents, and due to the ban on local production, they are being brought in from manufacturers in other states in which there is no ban of this kind. This large-scale usage was exponentially magnified during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.Counsel reiterated that reinforced cups, are the only eco-friendly alternative to plastic cups, and banning manufacture of them adversely affects only small shopkeepers, and the MSME enterprises that are especially promoted and supported by the government through loans and other schemes. In light of these facts, it was urged that the test of the reasonable person should be applied to balance development and environment and allow manufacture, albeit with stringent safeguards. Reliance was placed on this court's decision in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India13.18. Counsel on behalf of the manufacturer of non-woven carry bags, contended that such bags are made out of poly-propylene granules by spun-bonding fibres similar to polyester filaments used for manufacturing of sarees, shirts etc.; and nonwoven fabrics have wide usage14. They have weak chemical structure and are made of a mono-polymer, making it easy to segregate and recycle. Non-woven polypropylene carry bags are reusable alternatives to plastic bags. They have a fabric like structure with air and water permeability.Therefore, even if the nonwoven carry bags are discarded, there is no possibility for clogging or choking of water channel, drains, sewer lines etc., and affecting soil fertility. These fabrics are chemically inert and non-toxic and therefore, even burning these materials will not produce any poisonous gases or pollutants. The non-woven bags disintegrate on exposure to sun light and rainfall and can degrade within even 100 days.Even the test report issued by CIPET, it was argued, has proved that non-woven carry bags are 100% eco-friendly. The life Cycle Assessment study done by the Central Pollution Control Board, Ministry of Forest, and Climate Change, reveals that nonwoven carry bags are the real substitute and alternate for plastics, as they are porous in nature and air and water can pass through freely, and there is a real global warming impact in recycling paper and plastic.19. Counsel pointed out that non-woven carry bag fabric is classified as Technical Textile by, and promoted by, the Ministry of Textile, Government of India (GOI). Further, the non-woven polypropylene carry bags can be manufactured as per the requirement of customer and there is no fixed percentage of polypropylene i.e., all non-woven carry bags do not contain 98.2% polypropylene.It was argued that the non-woven carry bags contain less percentage of poly propylene, which varies from 57% to 70% while an average carry bag can be produced with 30% to 90% of polypropylene; and that the appellants are ready to manufacture the nonwoven carry bags with any fixed percentage as may be fixed by this Court or any other authority. In this way, the state can regulate the ratio of polypropylene in nonwoven carry bags by fixing the percentage of GSM. But the total ban or prohibition by branding it as 'one time use and throw' was unwarranted and disproportionate.20. Such a ban, it was argued, caused massive unemployment and rendered the machineries purchased useless as they could be used only to manufacture nonwoven carry bags and not for any other purposes. Therefore, it is contended by the learned counsel that the impugned ban is in violation of Article 19(1)(g) of The Constitution of India. Furthermore, counsel highlighted that the State government had entered into agreements with such small enterprises, that were manufacturing non-woven bags, as a part of various skill-development and entrepreneurship programmes promoted by the government.21. It was also submitted that non-woven polypropylene is used in various medical, industrial, and other applications including diapers, sanitary napkins etc., in terms of the 2016 Rules and they exhibit very high percentage values compared to non-woven carry bags. While the disposal of other poly-propylene products is permitted with treatment methods, if and when stipulated, it was urged that the same logic can be extended to non-woven polypropylene bags as well.Further, To demonstrate its safety, counsel pointed out that polypropylene is often used as a non-absorbable, synthetic suture material in medical implants, in specific surgeries, etc. which proves that it will not cause any health hazard to human being. It was further argued that scientific studies proved that even the discarded bags can be used as an ingredient for laying asphalt roads; this technology was not being utilized by the government. Instead of adopting and implementing ecological alternatives for re-use and re-cycling of the plastic, the Government had hastily imposed the ban without any scientific study preceding such ban.22. Regardless, that apart, counsel contended that non-woven carry bags cannot be categorised as one time or single use and throw away items. These will not be thrown away after one use and there is also no data to show that the non-woven carry bags are causing any impact on the environment. Given that they are not distributed for free, it is more compelling to conclude that people would not throw after single use, and will reuse.Further, waste segregation is an important task which the Municipal authorities or local body have to carry out. Instead of ensuring that the instrumentalities of the government are efficiently discharging such duties, the government had chosen to adopt a short cut method to ban the non-woven carry bags. If waste segregation is properly done by adopting scientific and novel methods, the ban may not be necessary.23. Further, before imposing the ban, the stakeholders were not consulted and no notice was issued to the manufacturers as a whole. Even though some of the associations approached the Government and gave their objections, it was argued that in itself could not dispense with the requirement to hear all the stakeholders who are likely to be affected before the ban.24. Counsel argued also on the absence of data to establish that non-woven bags in fact contribute so heavily to litter. On the other hand, if the state intended to give effect to the concept of micro plastics, they should also impose ban on other products (toothpaste, cosmetic items such as face wash, scrubs etc.), which directly affect the marine life. However, those products are not banned by the Government but it had chosen to ban only the non-woven carry bags and therefore, the impugned order is vitiated on the ground of discrimination.Counsel for the appellants urged that there is no alternative to non-woven carry bags and they are not made of 100% polypropylene. The consumption of water for manufacture of jute, paper and cotton, far exceeds the impact of polypropylene. Chemicals which are more toxic and harmful to environment and human existence are used in the manufacture of industrial products, such as mercury and cyanide, but they are not either banned or prohibited by citing flimsy and unfounded reasons.Respondents' contentions25. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu, relied on the provisions of the EPA, specifically - Section 23 (central government's power to delegate) and Section 5 (power to give directions). It was submitted that the impugned government order was well within the legislative competence of the State Government which issued the same under Section 5 of the EPA (pursuant to this power being delegated by the Central Government). This delegation of power, it was argued, empowered the state government to impose stringent regulations on any industry, operation, process including a complete or partial ban. Reliance was placed on AP Pollution Control Board v. Prof. M. Nayudu (Retd.) & Ors.1526. It was submitted that there was no repugnancy between the impugned government order and the 2016 Rules as they operate in distinct and independent fields. The Rules specify regulatory measures, compliance of which is essential for the grant of registration for plastic manufacturers in terms of these Rules, whereas the impugned notification only seeks to ban certain plastics that are harmful to the environment. The High Court had rightly accepted this position.16 Reliance was placed on Goodwill Plastic Industries v. Union Territory of Chandigarh17, the civil appeal against which, has also been disposed by this court.27. Counsel laboured on the right to clean and hygienic environment as one falling under Article 21 of the Constitution and that this trumped the commercial interests of the appellants. The doctrine of public trust was pressed into service to buttress counsel's arguments, and it was urged that the standard of judicial review to be applied by courts where environment protection and interests of the general public are a stake, is a narrow one. Counsel pointed out numerous cases in this regard.1828. The appellants' contention on violation of natural justice was strongly opposed; counsel highlighted that representation of both the appellants were taken into consideration by the respondent state government, and deliberations had also borne numerous clarifications. The High Court had rightly concluded that strict compliance with Rule 4 of the 1986 Rules was not warranted in the particular facts of the case and given the huge publicity around this ban.1929. Counsel insisted that the appellant associations had been given ample opportunity to be heard; on 14.11.2018, the associations were invited for a hearing by the Steering Committee, where the appellants urged that paper cups had not been banned in other states that had instituted a 'plastic ban'. It was only after hearing them, that the clarification dated 08.12.2018 was made - by which their representation was rejected.30. With regards to non-woven polypropylene bags, the State opposed the contention that it was a textile material and not plastic. CIPET has concluded that it is ""polypropylene, a synthetic plastic which is spun into fibres and bonded together by chemical or solvent treatment as non-woven fabric"". The filler material used in these bags make them stiffer, and water resistance. They easily break and thrown away frequently. It was stated that at high temperatures, polypropylene releases harmful substances and if it is used in a long period with slow degradation process, the potential crisis is more dangerous than plastic bags.It was submitted that the appellant itself claimed that this non-woven fabric degrades under sun light within a very short span of time; it physically breaks down into very small fragments (termed as 'disintegration') and is not degraded biologically to yield CO2, water, inorganic compounds and biomass and does not leave any visible distinguishable or toxic residue as for the case of compostable plastics (which is defined in 'IS/ISO 17088:2008 - Specifications for Compostable Plastics').Therefore, the small fragments (known as 'microplastics' and could in soil, freshwater, etc. and could have a long-term negative impact on such ecosystems. Reliance was placed on the Delhi High Court's observations in WP (C) No. 8120/200920 and the NGT's order21 with respect to ban and use of plastic bags in State of Punjab and Haryana which included non-woven bags.31. Attention was drawn to the three reports (IIT Madras Report, Report of Committee of Experts, and chemical tests conducted by CIPET) and counsel urged that the impugned notification was backed by expert data. Arguing that prohibition is only with respect to use and throw plastic, irrespective of whether they are recyclable or non-recyclable, as consumers nonchalantly discard these products widely, and litter unscrupulously, making it impossible to effectively collect, segregate and recycle. The High Court was justified in rejecting the appellants' challenge on this ground and holding that the ban is defensible on scientific analysis since these products were not biodegradable.Analysis and conclusionA. Relevant provisions32. Section 5 of the EPA, relates to the power to give directions:""5. POWER TO GIVE DIRECTIONS.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law but subject to the provisions of this Act, the Central Government may, in the exercise of its powers and performance of its functions under this Act, issue directions in writing to any person, officer or any authority and such person, officer or authority shall be bound to comply with such directionsExplanation-For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared that the power to issue directions under this section includes the power to direct-(a) the closure, prohibition or regulation of any industry, operation or process; or(b) stoppage or regulation of the supply of electricity or water or any other service.""By Notification dated 10.02.1988, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India, in exercise of its powers under Section 23 of the EPA, delegated its power vested under Section 5 of the Act, to numerous states - including Tamil Nadu. The Notification stated that the Central Government may revoke such delegation of powers in respect of all or any of the state governments, or may itself invoke Section 5 of the Act, if it found such course of action necessary in the interest of public interest.22 33. Rule 4 of the 1986 Rules, is to be read with Section 5, and is relied upon by the appellants:""4. DIRECTIONS -(1) Any direction issued under section 5 shall be in writing.(2) The direction shall specify the nature of action to be taken and the time within which it shall be complied with by the person, officer or the authority to whom such direction is given.(3) (a) The person, officer or authority to whom any direction is sought to be issued shall be served with a copy of the proposed direction and shall be given an opportunity of not less than fifteen days from the date of service of a notice to file with an officer designated in this behalf the objections, if any, to the issue of the proposed direction.(b) Where the proposed direction is for the stoppage or regulation of electricity or water or any other service affecting the carrying on any industry, operation or process and is sought to be issued to an officer or an authority, a copy of the proposed direction shall also be endorsed to the occupier of the industry, operation or process, as the case may be and objections, if any, filed by the occupier with an officer designated in this behalf shall be dealt with in accordance with the procedures under sub-rules (3a) and (4) of this rule:Provided that no opportunity of being heard shall be given to the occupier if he had already been heard earlier and the proposed direction referred to in sub-rule (3b) above for the stoppage or regulation of electricity or water or any other service was the resultant decision of the Central Government after such earlier hearing.(4) The Central Government shall within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of the objections, if any or from the date up to which an opportunity is given to the person, officer or authority to file objections whichever is earlier, after considering the objections, if any, received from the person, officer or authority sought to be directed and for reasons to be recorded in writing, confirm, modify or decide not to issue the proposed direction.(5) In case where the Central Government is of the opinion that in view of the likelihood of a grave injury to the environment it is not expedient to provide an opportunity to file objections against the proposed direction, it may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, issue directions without providing such an opportunity.(6) Every notice or direction required to be issued under this rule shall be deemed to be duly served (a) where the person to be served is a company, if the document is addressed in the name of the company at its registered office or at its principal office or place of business and is either-(i) sent by registered post, or(ii) delivered at its registered office or at the principal office or place of business;(b) where the person to be served is an officer serving Government, if the document is addressed to the person and a copy thereof is endorsed to this Head of the Department and also to the Secretary to the Government, as the case may be, in-charge of the Department in which for the time being the business relating to the Department in which the officer is employed is transacted and is either-(i) sent by registered post, or(ii) is given or tendered to him;(c) in any other case, if the document is addressed to the person to be served and-(i) is given or tendered to him, or(ii) if such person cannot be found, is affixed on some conspicuous part of his last known place of residence or business or is given or tendered to some adult member of his family or is affixed on some conspicuous part of the land or building, if any, to which it relates, or(iii) is sent by registered post to that personExplanation.-For the purpose of this sub-rule:-(a) ""company"" means any body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals;(b) ""a servant"" is not a member of the family""(emphasis supplied)34. That the State has the legislative competence to impose a ban - of the kind contained in the government order (one which may have the effect of affecting industries even) - in exercise of its power under Section 5 of the EPA, is borne out from a reading of the relevant provisions.35. The other regulations at play are the 2016 Rules which define 'plastic' and 'compostable plastics':""'plastics' mean material which contains as an essential ingredient, a high polymer such as polyethylene terephthalate, high density polyethylene, Vinyl, low density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene resins, multi-materials like acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyphenylene oxide, polycarbonate, Polybutylene terephthalate. 'compostable plastics' mean plastic that undergoes degradation by biological processes during composting to yield CO2, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with other known compostable materials, excluding conventional petro-based plastics, and does not leave visible, distinguishable or toxic residue;""36. At the outset, it is pertinent also to point out that the NGT dismissing the matter as not maintainable, struck this court, as rather strange. A quick glance at Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 reveals that orders issued under Section 5 of the EPA fall squarely within the NGT's remit:""16. Any person aggrieved by, - [...]""(g) any direction issued, on or after the commencement of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986;""37. The High Court, while deciding the question of natural justice, in light of Section 5 of the Act, read with Rule 4 of the Rules, held that since the ban only came into force on 01.01.2019 (i.e., 6 months after the date of the order), the petitioners were well aware of the ban and had even made representations that were heard and disposed, prior to the ban taking effect. Observing that individual notices cannot be expected to all concerned, it was held that when a policy decision of this nature is taken in larger public interest, there was no violation of principles of natural justice.38. In the present case, the paper cup association sent in their representation, received an opportunity for a personal hearing, and a committee of experts was constituted to consider their representation. It was only after this, on 08.12.2018, that their representation was disposed of, with reasons.39. A reference to Rule 4, indicates that it is mandatory. This court has dealt, in several cases with the question of post-facto decisional hearing. There is no gainsaying that principles of natural justice have to be complied with wherever the law requires that course. It is also an accepted principle that the silence of a statute or rule about natural justice, nevertheless, calls for a minimum hearing. At the same time, there have been cases, where the court has permitted post decisional hearing: notably in Liberty Oil Mills23.There the court recognized that there can be emergencies or urgent situations calling for immediate or expedient action, which cannot be delayed. In such eventualities, this court held that the rule of prior hearing can be dispensed with. In Dharampal Satyapal Ltd. v. CCE24 held that the principles of natural justice cannot be placed in a straitjacket, especially if a fair hearing would in any event have resulted in the same decision.25 A closer look at Rule 4(5) of the 1986 Rules reveals that it also contains within it, an exemption for furnishing prior notice in the interest of expediency.40. In the present case, there is no doubt that a pre-decisional hearing was not granted. Yet, the court cannot be oblivious of the fact that the state notified the rules, on 25.06.2018 and did not bring it into force immediately. The ban was made effective, only from 01.01.2019. The petitioners and other parties were afforded the opportunity to represent and make their views known, which they did. Undoubtedly, the state did not accept those views.The question then, is whether this court should insist that the failure to grant opportunity prior to the government order, should result in invalidation of the ban itself. If one keeps in mind the larger public interest sought to be subserved by the impugned government order, and also importantly the circumstance, that the Central Government notification dated 01.07.2022 has resulted in a complete ban on single use cups among other use and throw plastic products, the public interest cannot be ignored.41. Therefore, this court holds that though the mandate of the rule calls for predecisional hearing, in the peculiar facts of this case, given the efflux of time, the resultant likely injury to the public in the event the notification is interfered with, interests of justice require that such infraction should not result in the invalidation of the notification.B. Considering the ban, on merits42. Both counsel appearing for the appellants argued at length on the merits of the ban and whether the State Government had taken an appropriate decision to ban their respective products.(i) Paper cups43. The main argument of the petitioners is that the use of plastic in paper cups is minimal [the ratio being 6% plastic and 94% paper] and that the blanket ban, of their products, is unreasonable, arbitrary, and disproportionate. The report of the expert body, Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology, led to the reexamination of the issue, i.e., the ban on use of the petitioners' paper cups reinforced with plastic coating, and the TNPCB's subsequent order, dated 8.12.2018, which pertinently, reads as follows:""Based on the representation, an Expert Committee was constituted as per the instructions during the Steering Committee meeting. The Committee has reported that poly-coated paper cup contains 94% paper (cellulose) & 6% LDPE. Further TNPCB tested the LDPE coated disposable paper cup samples in CIPET. Chennai for material identification test analysis. As per CIPET results, paper cups are paper substrate coated with ethylene/ polyvinyl/ acetate which is a synthetic polymer. The polymeric nature is not easily degradable under natural environmental conditions. Accordingly, the LDPE coated disposable paper cups are banned and hence the representation cannot be considered""44. The Report submitted by IIT (on the basis of which, the ban was first imposed) states that consumption of reinforced paper cups would be deleterious to the environment as it would lead to cutting of more trees, and the recycling of which, will cause more pollution. It also recommended alternatives such as leaf products, kora grass, products made of coconut, screw pine, earthen products, steel products, etc. The Expert Committee Report, similarly, concluded that paper cups are near impossible to recycle due to the LDPE coating, while relying on the CIPET testing.45. That these cups are indiscriminately used and thrown, as a single use product (often to drink a warm beverage) - requires no statistics. By composition itself, they are non-biodegradable, and there is immense difficulty in their recycling, as it requires appropriate collecting mechanisms, strict segregation, to name a few of the challenges.The appellants insisted that that this is a situation of not having an effective collective mechanism, which the local municipal corporations are responsible for as per the 2016 Rules; they also offered to take up the responsibility. However, given that there is scientific basis for the ban, and it is the State Government's policy decision to ban numerous categories of single use plastic products, in public interest, there is little room or reason, for this court to interfere on the ground of merits of the ban.46. Therefore, the contention that the ban is over inclusive, and disproportionate, are in the considered opinion of this court, not made out in relation to reinforced paper cups. The appellant's right under Article 19(1)(g) has, without a doubt, been restricted; but in the larger interest of the general public to enjoy a pollution free environment the restriction was reasonable as per Article 19(6) of the Constitution of India, and is therefore, upheld.(ii) Non-woven plastic bags47. The ban of non-woven plastic bags was explained in the letter dated 08.12.2018 in response to a manufacturer-association seeking clarification. The letter read:""Non woven carry bags are made up of polypropylene, which does not easily degrade in natural environment. Further, non-woven fabric carry bag samples tested from CIPET, Chennai for Material Identification test analysis, indicates that it is a polypropylene (synthetic plastic). The polymeric nature is not easily degradable under natural environmental conditions. Accordingly, the non woven polypropylene carry bags are banned""48. This court is of the considered opinion that the arguments in the case of the non-woven bag, stand on a slightly different footing. These bags, it appears are reusable in nature to some extent. Their composition/proportion of polypropene and filler used, in the manufacture of these bags, is customizable. Therefore, the appellant contended that the overall ban was disproportionate.The State insisted that despite being said to be reusable to an extent, they are indiscriminately disposed and cause littering, which damage ground water, soil quality, etc., because they do not biodegrade properly, and this therefore, justified the ban. Unlike reinforced papercups, these bags are reusable, recyclable, and capable of some level of biodegradation (based on the composition), but no committee was constituted to looked into it more closely, and it was in fact brought within the scope of the ban subsequently by way of clarification; the ban of this product perhaps deserves further scrutiny.49. One of the arguments made by the appellants was that the State government should have taken into consideration that the Government of India had by order dated 13.12.2018, constituted an expert committee to define 'single use plastics' in view of the conflicting decisions by various state governments on ban of such products, and that the decision of the steering committee to proceed without waiting for the Union government's report is arbitrary and prejudicial.Though not applicable to the present lis, it is appropriate to note the amendments that have been made to the central Rules, since. The committee constituted by the Union Government, resulted in the Expert Committee Report on Single Use Plastics dated 19.09.2019 (which led to further amendments in the 2016 Rules).50. The 2016 Rules were amended in 2018, 2021, and 2022. While the 2022 Amendment26 inserted the definition of 'biodegradable plastics'27 in the Rules, the 2021 Amendment28 to the 2016 Rules, inserted the definition for 'non-woven bags' and 'single use plastic commodity' which read as follows:(na) ""Non-woven plastic bag"" means Non-woven plastic bag made up of plastic sheet or web structured fabric of entangled plastic fibers or filaments (and by perforating films) bonded together by mechanical or thermal or chemical means, and the ""non-woven fabric"" means a flat or tufted porous sheet that is made directly from plastic fibres, molten plastic or plastic films;â€Ÿ[...] (va) ""Single-use plastic commodity"" mean a plastic item intended to be used once for the same purpose before being disposed of or recycled;""These definitions are similar to the understanding that the State Government of Tamil Nadu employed, in the ban that is the subject of the present case.51. The 2021 Amendment also included a similar ban of single use plastic commodities w.e.f. 01.07.2022, through an amendment to Rule 4 which inserted sub-clause (2), (3) and (4):""(1) [...](2) The manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of following single use plastic, including polystyrene and expanded polystyrene, commodities shall be prohibited with effect from the 1st July, 2022:-(a) ear buds with plastic sticks, plastic sticks for balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks, ice-cream sticks, polystyrene [Thermocol] for decoration;(b) plates, cups, glasses, cutlery such as forks, spoons, knives, straw, trays, wrapping or packing films around sweet boxes, invitation cards, and cigarette packets, plastic or PVC banners less than 100 micron, stirrers.(3) The provisions of sub-rule (2) (b) shall not apply to commodities made of compostable plastic.(4) Any notification prohibiting the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of carry bags, plastic sheets or like, or cover made of plastic sheets and multilayered packaging and single-use plastic, including polystyrene and expanded polystyrene, commodities, issued after this notification, shall come into force after the expiry of ten years, from the date of its publication""52. The same Rule 4, was also amended in sub-clause (1), to regulate the manufacture of non-woven plastic bags, w.e.f. 01.09.2021:""( j) non-woven plastic carry bag shall not be less than 60 Gram Per Square Meter (GSM) with effect from the 30th September, 2021""53. Given that the amended 2016 Rules now allow non-woven bags above 60 GSM to be manufactured and used, i.e., the Centre has found a way to regulate it, rather than ban it - there is some merit in the appellant's contention regarding disproportionality.If a less onerous restriction on the appellant's Article 19(6) right is possible, it must be favoured. In light of the developments in terms of the amendment to the 2016 Rules, this court is of the considered opinion that it would be appropriate, and just, to remand the question of including non-woven bags within the single use plastic products ban, back to the TNPCB for consideration.54. In light of the foregoing discussion, the C.A. No. 8536/2022 is hereby disposed of, seeing no reason to interfere with the High Court's findings on the ban of reinforced papercups. C.A. Nos.8537-38/2022 are partly allowed in the above terms; wherein the TNPCB is hereby directed to consider the case of non-woven bags afresh, in light of the 2016 Rules (as amended).There shall be no order on costs.......................J.

SHANTANAGOUDAR, J.1. The judgment dated 19.03.2009 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 637 and 748 of 2004 passed by the High Court of Judicature atÂ  Madras whereby the High Court convicted the accused appellants for the abduction and murder of one Santhakumar, husband of the complainant Jeevajothi (PW1), is called into question in these appeals.2. The material facts leading to these appeals are as under: Accused No. 1 is the proprietor of a chain of hotels (Saravana Bhavan). Either upon the advice of an astrologer or having become besotted with PW1, Accused No.1 had evinced a keen desire to take PW1 as his third wife, though she was already married to Santhakumar (the deceased). In order to fulfil his desire, Accused No.1 used to financially help PW1, her family members and her husband. He used to talk to PW1 over the phone frequently, and also gave her costly gifts such as jewellery and silk sarees and even went to the extent of paying her medical bills. In a further bid to gain PW1's love and affection, he frequently interfered in her personal matters. Once when she was ill, under the pretext of better treatment as advised by another doctor, Accused No. 1 forcefully shifted her to another hospital, where he advised her not to have sexual relations with her husband and made her undergo a 2 series of tests. The deceased Santhakumar was instructed to get himself tested for AIDS and other such diseases, which he refused outright.3. On 01.10.2001, PW1 and her husband were abducted by Accused No.1 and his henchmen (including the appellants herein), for which a separate complaint (Ext. P3) was lodged by PW1 and a separate trial was conducted. Some of the accused therein were convicted. Separate appeals were also filed against the judgment of conviction for the incident of abduction. As they have been decided separately, we do not propose to discuss the said incident and offence in detail in these appeals.4. Accused No.1 took the help of the other appellants in order to eliminate the husband of PW1, for securing PW1 as his third wife. Subsequent to the incident of 01.10.2001 relating to abduction, Accused No. 2 contacted PW1 and told her that he regretted the previous events and suggested to PW1 to lodge a police complaint. A few days prior to the murder, Accused No. 2 instructed PW1 to tell her husband to come alone to a certain Sai Baba temple to meet a press reporter whom Accused No.2 personally knew in order to 3 highlight Accused No. 1's wrongdoings. In other words, Accused No.2 posed himself as a wellwisher of PW1 and the deceased.5. On 18.10.2001, PW1 as well as her husband went to the Sai Baba temple as instructed by Accused No. 2. Soon after, two Ambassador cars bearing Registration Nos. TN 09 T 3224 (M.O.1) and TN 22 5202 (M.O.2), and a Tata Sumo vehicle bearing Registration No. TN 09 Q 1310 (M.O.3) came and halted behind the car in which PW1 and her husband were sitting. Accused Nos. 3 and 4, armed with knives, got out of one of the cars and forced PW1 and her husband to board the car of the accused in which Accused No.5 was sitting, and took them to Chengalpattu. At about 8.30 p.m. on the same night, a Mercedes Benz bearing Registration No. TN 10 M 7755 (M.O.4) belonging to Accused No. 1 arrived with the parents of PW1 along with Accused No.1. Thereafter, PW2, the mother of PW1, informed PW1 that Accused No.1 was in the said Benz car, and wanted PW1 to leave her husband and meet Accused No.1 in the car. As PW1 resisted, Accused Nos. 3 and 4 forcibly took PW1 to the Benz car, and she was taken to Tiruchirappalli in the said car.6. On 19.10.2001, PW1 was taken to PW9 by Accused Nos.5 and 8 at Parappadi village, to remove the alleged influence of witchcraft (black magic) which was allegedly the cause of her being in love with Santhakumar. From there, she was taken to Veppankulam village to seek the advise of an astrologer (PW8). At the said place, an employee of Accused No.1, Janarthanam came and informed PW1 that her husband had escaped the clutches of the henchmen of Accused No.1 and his whereabouts were unknown. Subsequently, after spending the night at Hotel Ariyas at Tirunelveli, PW1 and her family, along with Accused Nos. 1, 5, 6 and 8 returned to Chennai by train.7. After two days, Santhakumar spoke to PW1 over a phone call and stated that Accused No. 2 had told him about being given Rs. 5 lakhs by Accused No.1 to kill him, but Accused No. 2 had let him go unharmed out of sympathy, and had asked him to escape to Mumbai and contact him from there after fifteen days. However, Santhakumar returned to PW1 upon her request. Subsequently, on 21.10.2001, both of them approached Accused No.1 to seek his mercy, thus revealing that Santhakumar was still alive. Later on 5 the same day, when Accused No.2 told Accused No.1 a false story about how he and the other accused had killed Santhakumar and destroyed the evidence, on Accused No.1's cue, Santhakumar and PW1 entered the room, much to the shock of Accused No.2. Disgraced and feeling betrayed, Accused No.2 started assaulting Santhakumar, and was joined by Accused Nos. 3 and 4. On 24.10.2001, they took the couple to the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police to withdraw the complaint relating to the incident of abduction which had been lodged earlier that month, and also made them sign a few blank papers. On the same day, Accused Nos. 5 and 6 took Santhakumar, PW1 and her family members in a Tata Sumo bearing Registration No. TN 10 M 7755 belonging to Accused No. 1, again to remove the influence of black magic on PW1, after which they reached Tirunelveli.8. On 26.10.2001, at about 6.30 a.m., Accused No. 5 came to the room in which PW1 and her family members were staying in Tirunelveli and informed them that Accused No.1 had instructed Santhakumar to be brought to him. Unwilling to send him alone, PW1 also went along with Santhakumar and Accused No.5. 6 Accused No. 1 made PW1 and her husband get into his Tata Sumo (Registration No. TN 10 M 7755). This vehicle, being driven by Accused No. 9, with Accused Nos. 5 and 8, PW1 and Santhakumar seated within, was followed by another Tata Sumo (M.O.3). Upon reaching the Karai Illupu culvert, and upon a signal by Accused No. 5, the other vehicle stopped, and Accused Nos. 2 to 4 and 6 alighted therefrom. Accused No.1 got out and grabbed Santhakumar by the collar, dragging him out. He pushed Santhakumar down and handed him over to Accused Nos. 2 to 4 and 6 and ordered them to ""finish him off"". The Tata Sumo (M.O. 3) driven by Accused No. 7 took Santhakumar along with the said accused towards Dindigul. Accused No. 1 and the other accused took PW1 back, and later brought her and her family back to Chennai.9. While PW1 was staying at her mother's house at Velachery, Accused Nos. 5, 8 and other henchmen of Accused No.1 kept a constant vigil over the movements of PW1 and her family. Thereafter, at the instance of Accused No.1, PW1 and her family members were taken to an astrologer by the name of Ravi (PW4), and later, she was made to undergo certain rituals, conducted by 7 one Raghunatha Iyer, in the presence of the second wife of Accused No.1 at K.K. Nagar. Later, much to her shock, PW1 learnt that these rituals were traditionally conducted by the wife after the death of her husband. Therefore, upon growing gravely suspicious, she lodged the first information on 20.11.2001 stating that Accused No.1 and his henchmen had murdered her husband, and the same was registered as Crime No.1047 of 2001.10. The motive put forth by the prosecution for the commission of the offence is that Accused No.1 wanted to take PW1 as his third wife despite knowing that she was already married to the deceased Santhakumar. Accused No.1 made several failed attempts with the help of the other accused to sever the relationship between PW1 and her husband. Ultimately, Accused No.1 committed the offence in question in order to eliminate the deceased so as to be able to marry PW1 without any obstruction.11. In the meanwhile, i.e. on 31.10.2001, prior to the lodging of the FIR, one forester by name Raman and Forest Guard Murugusen (PW26 and 27 respectively) of the Kodaikanal Range discovered the dead body of a male near the TigerChola forest area. On seeing the dead body, PW27 lodged the first information, Ext. P42, at Kodaikanal Police Station, which was registered as C.R. No. 559 of 2001, recording the finding of an unidentified body and its unnatural death.The postmortem was conducted on 01.11.2001 by PW35 and thereafter, as the body remained unidentified, it was buried in the Hindu burial ground of the Kodaikanal Municipality by PW33, Anithalai, in the presence of PW32, Head Constable Sebastian. Meanwhile, the accused had surrendered and confessed to the commission of Santhakumar's murder. Based on Accused No. 2's confession that he and the other accused had killed the victim and thrown the dead body in the forest area of TigerChola near a curve on the road, the investigation team proceeded to that place, and it was eventually determined that the dead body found by the forest officials was that of Santhakumar.The preburial photographs of the dead body clicked by the Kodaikanal Police (M.O. 11, 12, 13, 14) as well as the apparel found on the body of the deceased (M.O. 5, 6 and 8) were identified as Santhakumar's by PW1 and her family, as well as by some of the accused. The dead body was exhumed by PW33 and two others, and was sent for a second postmortem, which was conducted by PW38. During the 9 course of investigation, the procedure of superimposition of the face of the deceased was done by PW34, Dr. Jayaprakash, after which the dead body was concluded to be that of Santhakumar. After exhumation, the body was also identified by PWs 1 and 2 through a scar mark still visible on the waist. Charges were framed under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as ""the IPC"") including Sections 302, 364 and 201, and the trial was conducted.12. The Trial Court, upon evaluation of the material on record, convicted the accused appellants for the offences punishable under Sections 364, 304 Part I and 201 of the IPC. The accused appellants as well as the State appealed before the High Court, wherein the High Court while confirming the finding of guilt of the accused, modified the conviction for the offence punishable under Section 304 Part I to Section 302 of the IPC.The Trial Court as well as the High Court concluded that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, particularly that of PWs 1 and 2, along with the other supporting evidence, was believable and trustworthy; the motive for commission of the offence had been proved; the last seen circumstance had been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt; and that the recovery of the dead body based on the statement of Daniel (Accused No.2) had also been proved. Both the Courts tested the evidence of PW1 on the touchstone of consistency with the tenor of the case. The Trial Court, which had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of PWs 1 and 2, held that the discrepancies and contradictions, if any, were minor in nature, and did not affect the credibility and consistency of the evidence of PWs 1 and 2.13. The Courts, relying on the evidence of the doctors PWs 35 and 38, who conducted the two postmortem examinations, concluded that the death was homicidal in nature, as the cause of death was found to be asphyxia due to throttling.14. Shri Sushil Kumar, learned senior counsel for the appellants took us through the entire material on record and submitted that the circumstances relied upon by the prosecution have not been proved in accordance with law. He argued that the High Court and the Trial Court have merely proceeded on assumptions and conjectures, and the motive for commission of the offence has not 11 been proved, in addition to the fact that the evidence relating to the recovery of the dead body is shaky. He laid more stress on the argument that the first information in the present case (Ext. P1) registered on 20.11.2001 could not have been registered at all, inasmuch as there cannot be a second FIR relating to the same incident. According to him, the incident as found in the first information report dated 20.11.2001 is merely a continuation of the earlier offence of abduction which had taken place on 01.10.2001, which had generated proceedings pursuant to the first information lodged on 12.10.2001.Thus, according to him, the FIR in the present case would only assume the character of a statement recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter ""the Cr.P.C""), and the proceedings in this matter would stand vitiated. He further submitted that the first information of the abduction case dated 12.10.2001 had been marked and relied upon in the present matter as Ext. P3 and its use as a substantive piece of evidence was illegal. It was also argued that the evidence relating to the last seen circumstance as deposed by PW1 was not put to the accused while examining them under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C, and therefore, such portion of evidence could not be made use of by the prosecution against the accused. Learned counsel also submitted that the identification of the body merely on the basis of a superimposition test was improper, in the absence of a DNA test. Per contra, Shri Balaji Srinivasan, the learned Additional Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State, argued in support of the judgments of the Courts below.15. We do not find any force in the arguments of the learned Senior Advocate for the appellants that the incident of murder in the case in hand is merely a continuation of an earlier offence, i.e. Crime No. 1030 of 2001 relating to the abduction of PW1 and the deceased Santhakumar, which occurred on 01.10.2001. Undoubtedly, factors such as proximity of time or place, unity of purpose and design and continuity of action, in respect of a series of acts, have to be considered in order to determine whether such acts form part of the same transaction or not (See State of A.P. v. Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao, (1964) 3 SCR 297). A quick overview of the sequence of unfolding of the incident of murder in question and the prior incident of abduction would show that the above factors cannot be said to be satisfied in this case.Even when the two FIRs Ext. P1 and P3 are read together, it becomes clear that the first incident of abduction began and ended on 01.10.2001. The crime of abduction commenced when the victims (PW1 and the deceased) were forced into captivity on the said date, and was completed on the same day immediately after the victims were released. In respect of the said incident, the first information came to be lodged on 12.10.2001 by PW1. During the investigation of the said case, on 24.10.2001, the accused brought the deceased, PW1 and her family members to Tirunelveli.The present crime came to be committed on 26.10.2001, whereby PW1 and her husband, Santhakumar were taken away in a car, and on the direction of Accused No.1, Accused Nos. 2 to 4, 6 and 7 forcibly took away Santhakumar by separating him from his wife, committed his murder and threw away his body at the TigerChola forest area within the jurisdiction of Kodaikanal Police Station. Evidently, the time and place of occurrence of the two incidents are different. Even the number of accused involved in the incidents is different. No continuity of action can be gathered from the sequence of events either.It may be noted that the motive for commission of both the offences may be the same, inasmuch as they were committed to enable Accused No. 1 to marry PW1, but merely because of their common motive, the second offence cannot be said to be in continuation of the first incident, in light of there being distinct intentions behind the two offences. The first offence was committed with the intention to abduct the deceased and PW1, the purpose for which was merely to threaten and pressurize them. In contrast, the intention behind the second offence was to murder the deceased with a view to permanently get rid of him. Therefore, it is evident that unity of purpose and design between the two offences is also absent. Thus, it is amply clear that the incident of murder is entirely separate and distinct from the earlier incident of abduction.16. Undisputedly, the first information pertaining to the incident of abduction, after passing through various stages and various police officers, ultimately came to be registered as an FIR on 09.11.2001 in the jurisdictional Police Station. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the offence of abduction was completed on 15 01.10.2001 itself and the first information came to be lodged on 12.10.2001.17. There cannot be any dispute that a second FIR in respect of an offence or different offences committed in the course of the same transaction is not only impermissible but also violates Article 21 of the Constitution. In T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala, (2001) 6 SCC 181, this Court has categorically held that the registration of a second FIR (which is not a counter case) is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. It is relevant to note paragraphs 19, 20 and 27 of the said decision in that regard:""19. The scheme of CrPC is that an officer in charge of a police station has to commence investigation as provided in Section 156 or 157 CrPC on the basis of entry of the first information report, on coming to know of the commission of a cognizable offence. On completion of investigation and on the basis of the evidence collected, he has to form an opinion under Section 169 or 170 CrPC, as the case may be, and forward his report to the Magistrate concerned under Section 173(2) CrPC. However, even after filing such a report, if he comes into possession of further information or material, he need not register a fresh FIR; he is empowered to make further investigation, normally with the leave of the court, and where during further investigation he collects further evidence, oral or documentary, he is obliged to forward the same with one or more further reports; this is the import of subsection (8) of Section 173 CrPC.20. From the above discussion it follows that under the scheme of the provisions of Sections 154, 155, 156, 157, 162, 169, 170 and 173 CrPC only the earliest or the first information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence satisfies the requirements of Section 154 CrPC. Thus there can be no second FIR and consequently there can be no fresh investigation on receipt of every subsequent information in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence or incident giving rise to one or more cognizable offences. On receipt of information about a cognizable offence or an incident giving rise to a cognizable offence or offences and on entering the FIR in the station house diary, the officer in charge of a police station has to investigate not merely the cognizable offence reported in the FIR but also other connected offences found to have been committed in the course of the same transaction or the same occurrence and file one or more reports as provided in Section 173 CrPC.x x x x x x x x x x27. A just balance between the fundamental rights of the citizens under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution and the expansive power of the police to investigate a cognizable offence has to be struck by the court. There cannot be any controversy that subsection (8) of Section 173 CrPC empowers the police to make further investigation, obtain further evidence (both oral and documentary) and forward a 17 further report or reports to the Magistrate. In Narang case [Ram Lal Narang v. State (Delhi Admn.), (1979) 2 SCC 322 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 479] it was, however, observed that it would be appropriate to conduct further investigation with the permission of the court. However, the sweeping power of investigation does not warrant subjecting a citizen each time to fresh investigation by the police in respect of the same incident, giving rise to one or more cognizable offences, consequent upon filing of successive FIRs whether before or after filing the final report under Section 173(2) CrPC.It would clearly be beyond the purview of Sections 154 and 156 CrPC, nay, a case of abuse of the statutory power of investigation in a given case. In our view a case of fresh investigation based on the second or successive FIRs, not being a countercase, filed in connection with the same or connected cognizable offence alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction and in respect of which pursuant to the first FIR either investigation is under way or final report under Section 173(2) has been forwarded to the Magistrate, may be a fit case for exercise of power under Section 482 CrPC or under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution.""18. However, the aforementioned principles of law may not be applicable to the facts of the incident on hand, as the crimes underlying the two FIRs are distinct and different. The offence punishable under Section 302, in the present case, was committed during the course of investigation of the case in the first FIR, i.e. relating to the crime of abduction. We are of the considered opinion that the allegations and offences under this present FIR relating to the murder of the deceased are substantially distinct from the information lodged in Crime No. 1030 of 2001 relating to abduction. We are unable to accept the argument of Shri Sushil Kumar that at the most, further investigation could have been made by the police in the earlier crime registered relating to abduction since the murder has allegedly taken place during the subsistence of investigation of the crime of abduction.As mentioned supra, the facts and circumstances of the matter clearly indicate that the offence of abduction committed by the appellants and the offence of murder were two different and distinct offences, and therefore, there is no question of further investigation to be made in the crime of abduction by the investigating agency relating to the offence of murder which was committed during the subsistence of the investigation relating to abduction. Further investigation, as envisaged under Subsection 8 of Section 173 of the Cr.P.C, connotes investigation of the case in continuation of an earlier investigation with respect to which the chargesheet has already been filed.In case a fresh offence is committed during the course of 19 the earlier investigation, which is distinct from the offence being investigated, such fresh offence cannot be investigated as part of the pending case, and should instead be investigated afresh. It is pertinent to note that the facts on hand are similar to the facts in the case of Awadesh Kumar Jha v. State of Bihar, (2016) 3 SCC 8, wherein this Court held that the case arising out of a second FIR, if relating to a separate transaction, cannot be investigated along with a previous FIR under the clause 'further investigation' as contemplated under Subsection 8 to Section 173 of the Cr.P.C.19. In Rameshchandra Nandlal Parikh v. State of Gujarat, (2006) 1 SCC 732, earlier judgments of this Court including T.T. Antony (supra) were considered, and it was held that in case the FIRs are not in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence giving rise to one or more cognizable offences, and have not been alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction or the same occurrence as the ones alleged in the first FIR, there is no prohibition on accepting the second FIR. In this respect, in the case of Nirmal Singh Kahlon v. State of Punjab, (2009) 1 SCC 441, this Court observed thus:""67. The second FIR, in our opinion, would be maintainable not only because there were different versions but when new discovery is made on factual foundations. Discoveries may be made by the police authorities at a subsequent stage.Discovery about a larger conspiracy can also surface in another proceeding, as for example, in a case of this nature. If the police authorities did not make a fair investigation and left out conspiracy aspect of the matter from the purview of its investigation, in our opinion, as and when the same surfaced, it was open to the State and/or the High Court to direct investigation in respect of an offence which is distinct and separate from the one for which the FIR had already been lodged.""20. We may also refer to the following observations made by this Court in the case of Babubhai v. State of Gujarat, (2010) 12 SCC 254, while considering a similar question:""20. Thus, in view of the above, the law on the subject emerges to the effect that an FIR under Section 154 CrPC is a very important document. It is the first information of a cognizable offence recorded by the officer in charge of the police station. It sets the machinery of criminal law in motion and marks the commencement of the investigation which ends with the formation of an opinion under Section 169 or 170 CrPC, as the case may be, and forwarding of a police report under Section 173 CrPC.Thus, it is quite possible that more than one piece of information be given to the police officer in charge of the police station in respect of the same incident involving one or more than one cognizable offences. In such a case, he need not enter each piece of information in the diary. All other information given orally or in writing after the commencement of the investigation into the facts mentioned in the first information report will be statements falling under Section 162 CrPC.21. In such a case the court has to examine the facts and circumstances giving rise to both the FIRs and the test of sameness is to be applied to find out whether both the FIRs relate to the same incident in respect of the same occurrence or are in regard to the incidents which are two or more parts of the same transaction. If the answer is in the affirmative, the second FIR is liable to be quashed. However, in case, the contrary is proved, where the version in the second FIR is different and they are in respect of the two different incidents/crimes, the second FIR is permissible. In case in respect of the same incident the accused in the first FIR comes forward with a different version or counterclaim, investigation on both the FIRs has to be conducted.""(emphasis supplied)In light of the aforementioned settled legal proposition, we have no hesitation in holding that the separate first information lodged in this case is just, legal and proper. 21. Furthermore, it is no doubt true that the first information relating to the crime of abduction dated 12.10.2001 was marked in 22 the case on hand relating to murder. However, we cannot accept the contention that the same has been used as a substantive piece of evidence in this matter. This is because the said document was practically used only as supportive material to show the motive for the accused to commit the crime.22. Coming to the merits of the matter, it is pertinent to note that the prosecution mainly relied upon three circumstances to prove the guilt of the accused, i.e. motive, the last seen circumstance and the recovery of the dead body at the instance of the accused. An additional link in the chain of circumstances is the nonexplanation by the accused about the last seen circumstance in their statement recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. Clearly, there is no direct evidence in this matter and the whole case rests on circumstantial evidence. Before we undertake a consideration of the evidence supporting such circumstances, we would like to note that the law relating to circumstantial evidence is well settled.The Judge while deciding matters resting on circumstantial evidence should always tread cautiously so as to not allow conjectures or suspicion, however strong, to take the place of proof. If the alleged circumstances are conclusively proved before the Court by leading cogent and reliable evidence, the Court need not look any further before affirming the guilt of the accused. Moreover, human agency may be faulty in expressing the picturisation of the actual incident, but circumstances cannot fail or be ignored. As aptly put in this oftquoted phrase: ""Men may lie, but circumstances do not"".As mentioned supra, the circumstances relied upon by the prosecution should be of a conclusive nature and they should be such as to exclude every other hypothesis except the one to be proved by the prosecution regarding the guilt of the accused. There must be a chain of evidence proving the circumstances so complete so as to not leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion of innocence of the accused. Although it is not necessary for this Court to refer to decisions concerning this legal proposition, we prefer to quote the following observations made in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, (1984) 4 SCC 116 (SCC p. 185 para 153154):""153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established:(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established. It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned ""must or should"" and not ""may be"" established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between ""may be proved"" and ""must be or should be proved"" as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra 1973 CriLJ 1783 where the following observations were made: ""Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a Court can convict and the mental distance between 'may be' and 'must be' is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.""(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency,(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human 25 probability the act must have been done by the accused.154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence.""23. In order to satisfy our conscience, we have independently considered the evidence on record in its entirety in view of the aforementioned principles. However, as we do not wish to burden this judgment by reiterating the depositions of all the witnesses on record in detail, we deem it fit to discuss only the important aspects highlighted by some of the prosecution witnesses in their testimony.24. It would be appropriate to begin with the testimony of PW1, the wife of the deceased. She has deposed in detail as to how Accused No.1 wanted to marry her and how he often tried to lure her through undue favours. She has deposed that as Accused No.1 wished to take her as his third wife, he wanted to separate her from her husband.Whenever PW1 or her family were in need of money, Accused No.1 would generously help them. He even used to talk to PW1 over the phone regularly, and used to interfere in her personal matters unwarrantedly. She has narrated elaborately about the 26 prior incident of abduction as well. As far as the matter on hand is concerned, she has deposed that on 24.10.2001, PW1, her parents and the deceased were taken by Accused No.1 and the other accused to different places and they ultimately reached Tirunelveli. In the early hours of 26.10.2001, Accused No.5 asked the deceased to meet Accused No.1. PW1, being reluctant to send the deceased alone with Accused No. 5, went along with her husband to meet Accused No. 1, who made PW1 and the deceased get into the vehicle bearing Registration No. TN 10 M 7755 (driven by Accused No. 9) along with himself and Accused Nos. 5 and 8. On the way, upon the signal of Accused No. 5, Accused Nos. 2, 4 and 6 got down from a vehicle (M.O. 3) which had been following behind, and took away the deceased.Accused No. 1 further instructed these accused to ""finish him off"", definitely intending to instruct them to kill the deceased. Thereafter, PW1 was forcibly taken back by Accused No.1 and later was made to undergo different rituals, which made her suspect the murder of her husband and led her to lodge a complaint regarding the same. 27 PW1 has also deposed about the identification of the clothes worn by the deceased at the time of leaving her company, on which basis she identified the clothes on the discovered dead body to be those of Santhakumar's. She also identified his personal belongings that were recovered from Accused No.6. She has deposed about the exhumation of the dead body and her identification of the dead body based on the scar on the left side of her husband's waist.She has meticulously deposed about the role of each of the appellants in the crime. In the crossexamination, she has also explained the delay in lodging the first information by deposing that she could not file the complaint before 20.11.2001 though her husband was abducted on 26.10.2001 because she was under the constant surveillance of Accused No. 1 and his henchmen and could only free herself after 06.11.2011.Also, importantly, in the first incident (being the incident of abduction, i.e. Crime No. 1030 of 2001), her husband had been spared by Accused No. 1, and on a subsequent occasion also, he had been spared by Accused No. 2. Thus, she was hopeful that her husband would escape on this occasion as well. She also admitted in the crossexamination that her mother 28 had informed her that if she married Accused No.1, he would set up a business for their family and also pay them Rs. 10 Lakhs. Though PW1 was crossexamined at length, the defence could not discredit her evidence on material particulars. Minor variations pointed out by the defence, as such neither affect the prosecution version nor PW1's evidence in its entirety.25. In effect, PW1 has deposed about the aspect of motive, the last seen circumstance as well as the identification of the personal belongings of the deceased and his dead body. She is the witness who saw the deceased in the company of the accused for the last time before his death. While the date on which she saw the deceased with the accused was 26.10.2001, the dead body was found on 31.10.2001, i.e. within five days of the incident, and as per the postmortem report given by PW35, Dr. A. Sivakumar, the victim appeared to have died 35 days prior to the examination, which was conducted on 02.11.2001. This fact is well corroborated by the examinationinchief of PW35 as well.26. The evidence of PW1 is fully supported by the evidence of PW2, the mother of PW1. PW2 has deposed about the conduct of Accused No.1 towards her family members, as well as the dishonourable motive of Accused No.1 to marry PW1 and make her his third wife. She has fully corroborated the evidence of PW1 regarding the events of the day of the incident as well as the preceding days. She has testified to the fact that Accused No.5 came to their room in Tirunelveli and asked the deceased to go along with Accused No.1.However, PW1 also went along with them, but she returned to the room alone, crying, and revealed that the accused had beaten the deceased and taken him away. She has also deposed about Accused No.1 taking PW1 to an astrologer, and for removing the influence of black magic, etc.; and that she was present during the exhumation of the body and had identified the dead body of her soninlaw by the scar mark on his waist. She had also identified the belongings of the deceased. In her crossexamination, she denied the suggestion made to her by the defence that PW1 had falsely lodged the complaint to extract money from Accused No.1. She has also explained the delay in filing the FIR, stating that her house was being monitored by Accused No.1 and his aides and that she was hoping that the deceased would return safely, as he had previously.The evidence of PW2 fully corroborates the evidence of PW1. It is evident from the above discussion that the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 with regard to the motive for commission of the offence, the last seen circumstance and recovery as well as the identification of the dead body is consistent with the case of the prosecution. We do not find any artificiality in their evidence. On the other hand, their evidence remains natural, consistent, cogent and probable, and thus we do not find any reason to disagree with the findings arrived at in that regard by the Trial Court as well as by the High Court.27. The testimony of PW7, the Village Administrative Officer working in the office of the Tehsildar, is also relevant and significant. As per the requisition of the Assistant Commissioner of Police, PW7 went to the Chennai Kotturpuram Police Station on 30.11.2001. In his presence, Accused No.2 confessed to the Inspector of Police, PW42, that if taken to Kodaikanal, he would show the spot at TigerChola where the dead body of Santhakumar was thrown. Accordingly, Accused No.2 was taken to the said place 31 on 01.12.2001 and he pointed out the place of disposal of the body, and also identified the dead body of the deceased from the photographs available with the police.PW7 further deposed that PWs 1 and 2, who came the next day, i.e., on 02.12.2001, also identified the dead body shown in the photographs, and the body was exhumed after 2 days, after completing the formalities. He also deposed that on 13.12.2001, Accused No.6 confessed that if taken to his colony at Saligramam Road, he would identify and produce the wallet (M.O.7) and gold chain (M.O.9) of the deceased, and the same were recovered at the instance of Accused No. 6. PW7 has also deposed about the recovery of one lungi (M.O. 15) from the Tata Sumo in which the deceased was last seen. Nothing material worth considering in favour of the defence has been extracted from the crossexamination of PW7.It was argued by Shri Sushil Kumar that the confession made by Accused No.2 before PW7 was not admissible in evidence. There cannot be any dispute that a confession made by the accused in police custody is an inadmissible confession. The confession herein cannot even be called an extrajudicial confession because of the 32 presence of the police. Be that as it may, if a confession is made by the accused before the police and a portion of the confession leads to the recovery of any incriminating material, such portion alone is admissible under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. Since only such portion of the confession relating to the recovery of certain material objects was admitted in evidence and relied upon, such reliance was in accordance with law.28. The testimony of PWs 26, 27, 29, 32 and 33 pertains to the vital aspect of the recovery of the body of the deceased. PW26 Raman, the forester, has deposed that while he was working with Forest Guard Murugesan (PW27) on 31.10.2001, they found a dead body lying at TigerChola in an abyss in the forest. The body had a bluecoloured checked fullsleeved shirt and sandalcoloured pant with a blackcoloured belt. After seeing the dead body, PW26 and PW27 went to the Kodaikanal Police Station and lodged the first information (Ext. P42) with regard to the discovery of the unidentified dead body.Thereafter, the police came to the spot along with a camera and took photographs of the dead body. PW27 33 has reaffirmed what has been stated by PW26 and has deposed that the dead body was taken to the hospital by the police for autopsy. PW29, the SubInspector of Police of Kodaikanal Police Station, has deposed that on 31.10.2001, PWs 26 and 27 lodged the complaint which came to be registered on the same day.Thereafter, PW29 along with other personnel went to the concerned spot at TigerChola, and saw the dead body of a male aged about 30 years wearing the aforementioned clothes. He took the photographs of the dead body from all angles and prepared the observation mahazar (Ext. P45) and panchnama of the dead body (Ext. P46). Thereafter, the dead body was sent to the government hospital for postmortem examination. Since the body was unidentified and no relatives could be found, he asked Head Constable Sebastian (PW32) to bury the body in the municipality burial ground. He also told PW32 to mark the place where the dead body was buried. In the crossexamination, he has denied the suggestion that the pictures mentioned were merely photographs of the original photographs taken on the spot of discovery.Further, he has deposed that he conducted an inquest of the dead body and prepared the same under the light of a Petromax. Although he saw a scar on the dead body, he did not mention the same in the observation mahazar. The colour of the shirt was seen as brown in the light of the Petromax, but on rechecking it in morning, he realized that it was actually blue, and thus struck it out and corrected it accordingly in the mahazar. PW32, the Head Constable, has reiterated what has been deposed by PW29. He was present during the burial of the dead body by PW33 Anithalai, and instructed him to place an identifier on the spot of burial. PW32 exhumed the dead body in the presence of the Tehsildar, upon whose direction, he kept the dead body at a place that was elevated.He also deposed that PW1, Jeevajothi, identified the dead body to be that of her husband and had left the place crying. PW32's version as to the burial was corroborated by PW33, who has deposed that he buried the body and put the identification mark of a blue metal stone near the head to identify the place.29. We may also briefly discuss the testimony of PWs 35 and 38 (the doctors who conducted the postmortems of the deceased). 35 PW35 conducted the first postmortem examination. He has stated in his examination-in-chief that the hyoid bone in the neck was found broken and the brain was found decomposed. He opined that the person could have died 3 to 5 days prior to the postmortem examination.The hyoid bone in the neck could have been broken due to strangulation of the said person by using materials like a lungi. PW38, who conducted the second postmortem examination upon exhumation of the dead body, was also present at the spot of exhumation. PW38 deposed that while the body was being exhumed, he had noticed that a wooden stick had been put up along with a small stone on the southern part of the place. He also deposed that there was an old injury scar on the right lower abdomen of the dead body, the hyoid bone was broken, and that the fracture found in the hyoid bone was antemortem, which was confirmed through a Bensidine test. He opined that the cause of death appeared to be compression of the neck.30. It is also relevant to note the testimony of PW36, the handwriting expert. During the course of investigation, the records of the various hotels in which the accused had stayed along with 36 the deceased, PW1 and her family were collected. PW36 compared the handwritings in the hotel records with the handwritings of the accused and opined the former to belong to Accused Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 8. This supports the conclusion that the accused in fact took PW1 and her family members to various places as deposed by them.31. Shri Sushil Kumar also argued that a DNA test should have been conducted in order to identify the dead body, and identification merely on the basis of a superimposition test, which is not a tangible piece of evidence, may not be proper. One cannot lose sight of the fact that DNA evidence is also in the nature of opinion evidence as envisaged in Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act. Undoubtedly, an expert giving evidence before the Court plays a crucial role, especially since the entire purpose and object of opinion evidence is to aid the Court in forming its opinion on questions concerning foreign law, science, art, etc., on which the Court might not have the technical expertise to form an opinion on its own. In criminal cases, such questions may pertain to aspects such as ballistics, fingerprint matching, handwriting 37 comparison, and even DNA testing or superimposition techniques, as seen in the instant case.32. The role of an expert witness rendering opinion evidence before the Court may be explained by referring to the following observations of this Court in Ramesh Chandra Agrawal v. Regency Hospital Limited & Ors., (2009) 9 SCC 709:""16. The law of evidence is designed to ensure that the court considers only that evidence which will enable it to reach a reliable conclusion. The first and foremost requirement for an expert evidence to be admissible is that it is necessary to hear the expert evidence. The test is that the matter is outside the knowledge and experience of the lay person. Thus, there is a need to hear an expert opinion where there is a medical issue to be settled. The scientific question involved is assumed to be not within the court's knowledge. Thus cases where the science involved, is highly specialized and perhaps even esoteric, the central role of an expert cannot be disputed...""(emphasis supplied)Undoubtedly, it is the duty of an expert witness to assist the Court effectively by furnishing it with the relevant report based on his expertise along with his reasons, so that the Court may form its independent judgment by assessing such materials and reasons furnished by the expert for coming to an appropriate conclusion. Be 38 that as it may, it cannot be forgotten that opinion evidence is advisory in nature, and the Court is not bound by the evidence of the experts. (See The State (Delhi Adminstration) v. Pali Ram, (1979) 2 SCC 158; State of H.P. v. Jai Lal & Ors., (1999) 7 SCC 280; Baso Prasad & Ors. v. State of Bihar, (2006) 13 SCC 65; Ramesh Chandra Agrawal v. Regency Hospital Ltd. & Ors. (supra); Malay Kumar Ganguly v. Dr. Sukumar Mukherjee & Ors., (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 299).33. Like all other opinion evidence, the probative value accorded to DNA evidence also varies from case to case, depending on facts and circumstances and the weight accorded to other evidence on record, whether contrary or corroborative. This is all the more important to remember, given that even though the accuracy of DNA evidence may be increasing with the advancement of science and technology with every passing day, thereby making it more and more reliable, we have not yet reached a juncture where it may be said to be infallible. Thus, it cannot be said that the absence of DNA evidence would lead to an adverse inference against a party, especially in the 39 presence of other cogent and reliable evidence on record in favour of such party.34. This leads us to the question of the propriety of relying upon the superimposition test conducted in the instant case for identifying the deceased. As noted supra, the learned counsel for the appellants has argued that evidence pertaining to the use of the superimposition technique is not a tangible piece of evidence. We find ourselves unable to agree with this view. There cannot be any dispute that evidence on superimposition is also based on experts' opinion. We would like to note that the use of the superimposition technique in Indian investigations for identification purposes is not a new phenomenon. Notably, it has been employed in the investigations pertaining to the Nithari murders, the Russian murder incident in Goa in 2008, and even before that in the Morni Hill murder case and the Paharganj bomb blast case as far back as in 1996, and the Udhampur murder case in 2005 (See Modi, A Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, 26th edn., 2018, pp. 267271).This Court itself has placed reliance on identification of the deceased through superimposition on several occasions (see 40 Shankar & Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1994) 4 SCC 478; Swamy Shraddananda v. State of Karnataka, (2007) 12 SCC 288; Inspector of Police, Tamil Nadu v. John David, (2011) 5 SCC 509; Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde v. State of Maharashtra, (2014) 4 SCC 292), clearly indicating that it is an acceptable piece of opinion evidence.35. It is relevant to note that all of the decisions of this Court cited in the above paragraph were based on circumstantial evidence, involving aspects such as the last seen circumstance, motive, recovery of personal belongings of the deceased, and so on, and therefore in none of the cases was the superimposition technique the sole incriminating factor relied upon to reach a conclusion of guilt of the accused. Indeed, in Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde (supra), the Court also had the advantage of referring to a DNA test, and in John David (supra), of referring to a DNA test as well as dental examination of the deceased, to determine the identity of the victim. This is in line with the settled practice of the Courts, which generally do not rely upon opinion evidence as the sole incriminating circumstance, given its fallibility. This is particularly true for the superimposition technique, which cannot be regarded as infallible.36. In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High Court was justified in observing that a superimposition test cannot be taken as a conclusive one for the identification of a dead body, because by itself it may not conclusively establish identification. However, the High Court rightly accepted the expert testimony on this aspect since in the instant case, the superimposition test was merely one piece of evidence relied upon by the prosecution to corroborate the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 in order to strengthen its case.37. Moreover, it is evident from the testimony of PW34, Dr. Jayaprakash, who conducted the superimposition test, that the test was conducted by using three different methods, i.e. video superimposition, visual observation, and dental trait superimposition, and in spite of challenges to the reliability of such evidence, the Courts, after carefully assessing the methodology adopted, accepted the finding reached by PW34 regarding the 42 identification of the body, and we see no error in such conclusion reached by the Courts.38. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the scientific evidence of PW34 was rightly believed by the Trial Court as well as by the High Court, and strengthens the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 regarding the identification of the body. Though a DNA test would have helped the Courts immensely in determining the reliability of the identification of the body of the deceased, in the presence of other reliable evidence on record in favour of the prosecution version on this aspect, we reject the contention that the nonconducting of a DNA test and the reliance on evidence regarding identification through superimposition is improper. This is all the more true since no material is forthcoming to the effect that the parents of the deceased were alive during the relevant period, so as to conduct comparative DNA tests.39. It is noteworthy to emphasise that based on the confession of Accused No.6, recoveries of a wallet containing a photograph of PW1, gold chain etc. were effected from his house, which, as mentioned supra, also stand positively identified by PW1 and her family as belonging to the deceased.40. From the evidence of the witnesses discussed supra, it is amply clear that the dead body recovered from TigerChola was identified by PW1 and her family members as Santhakumar's, and the same body was exhumed from the burial grounds. It is evident from the depositions that the recovery of the dead body was made from the TigerChola forest area, which is the same place to which Accused No. 2 led the investigation team based on his confession about disposal of the dead body. It is relevant to note at this juncture that merely because the actual recovery of the body happened before the accused lead the police to the scene, it does not, in the facts and circumstances of this case, negate the validity of the recovery based on a confession, in terms of Section 27 of the Evidence Act. In our considered view, the recovery of the body of the deceased at the instance of Accused No. 2 and the identification of the body as that of Santhakumar by PW1, her family as well as by the accused, on the basis of photographs, the clothes and belongings of the deceased, and his scar, stand proved beyond all reasonable doubt.41. As mentioned supra, the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 proves the circumstance relating to the last seen evidence beyond reasonable doubt, apart from other circumstances. Both of them in their evidence (especially PW1), as mentioned supra, have consistently and cogently deposed that the deceased was last seen along with the accused, who took the deceased away upon the orders of Accused No. 1. No explanation, much less any plausible explanation has come from the accused in their statements under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C rebutting the strong evidence against them. Though the burden had shifted onto the accused to explain the said circumstance as to when they left the company of the deceased, no explanation was adduced in that regard by the accused herein. Hence, an adverse inference has to be drawn against the accused.It may be noted that such nonexplanation by the accused provides an additional link in the chain of circumstances. Furthermore, although it was argued by Shri Sushil Kumar that the evidence relating to the last seen circumstance as deposed by PW1 was not put to the accused while recording their statement under Section 313, such an argument cannot be accepted, since Question No. 22 and Question No. 30 specifically relate to the evidence of the last seen circumstance, and were put to Accused No.1. Same is the case with the other appellants.A perusal of the statements of the accused recorded under Section 313 also reveals that the relevant questions pertaining to taking Santhakumar along with PW1 in the car on 26.10.2001, detection of the decomposed dead body and the postmortem thereof were all put to the accused so as to fully enable them to explain all the incriminating circumstances appearing against them in the evidence adduced by the prosecution. It is needless to observe that it has been established through a catena of judgments of this Court that the doctrine of last seen, if proved, shifts the burden of proof onto the accused, placing on him the onus to explain how the incident occurred and what happened to the victim who was last seen with him.Failure on part of the accused to furnish any explanation in this regard, as in the case in hand, or furnishing false explanation 46 would give rise to a strong presumption against him, and in favour of his guilt, and would provide an additional link in the chain of circumstances. (See Rohtash Kumar v. State of Haryana, (2013) 14 SCC 434; Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra, (2006) 10 SCC 681).42. It is also relevant to note that the bill book and cash book of a petrol pump at Palani (Ext. P32), where the Tata Sumo bearing Registration No. TN 09 Q 1310 (M.O.3) was refuelled, were also seized. This is very crucial evidence to show that the Tata Sumo in which the accused were travelling along with the deceased had in fact gone towards Kodaikanal, as is evident from the fact that fuel was filled from a petrol pump enroute to Kodaikanal at Palani on the relevant date.43. In our considered opinion, the overwhelming, consistent, cogent and reliable testimonies of PWs 1 and 2, along with the aforementioned corroborative evidence, conclusively prove the prosecution case. We reiterate that PWs 1 and 2 were steadfast in their testimony about the motive, the last seen circumstance, recovery of the dead body based on the confession of Accused No.2, and about the identification of the dead body.We do not find any embellishment or exaggeration in the evidence of these witnesses. Moreover, the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses (especially PWs 7, 26, 27, 29, 32 and 33) is homogeneous, consistent and reliable, and corroborates the testimony of PWs 1 and 2, which leads us to conclude that the chain of circumstances is complete and points solely at the guilt of the accused. In our considered opinion, the prosecution has proved the complicity of all the appellants in murdering Santhakumar by strangulating him and thereafter throwing the dead body at TigerChola.It is worth recalling that while it is necessary that proof beyond reasonable doubt should be adduced in all criminal cases, it is not necessary that such proof should be perfect, and someone who is guilty cannot get away with impunity only because the truth may develop some infirmity when projected through human processes. The traditional dogmatic hypertechnical approach has to be replaced by a rational, realistic and genuine approach for administering justice in a criminal trial. Justice cannot be made sterile by exaggerated adherence to the rule of proof, inasmuch as the benefit of doubt must always be reasonable and not fanciful. (See Inder Singh v. State (Delhi Administration), (1978) 4 SCC 161; State of H.P. v. Lekh Raj & Anr., (2000) 1 SCC 247; Takhaji Hiraji v. Thakore Kubersing Chamansing & Ors., (2001) 6 SCC 145; Chaman & Anr. v. State of Uttarakhand, (2016) 12 SCC 76).44. Having regard to the entire material on record and the totality of the facts and circumstances, we find that the evidence on record fully proves the case of the prosecution and that the Trial Court as well as the High Court evaluated the material on record in its proper prospective while coming to their conclusion. Thus, the judgment of the Trial Court as modified by the High Court need not be interfered with. Hence these appeals fail and stand dismissed............................................J. (N.V.
