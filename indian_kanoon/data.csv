This Letters Patent Appeal has been tiled against the judgment dated 21.2.1995 passed by a learned single Judge disposing of a writ petition filed by the respondent.  
 2. The writ petition was filed on 11,3.1992 seeking directions against Hon'ble the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, the appellant herein, to declare the result of the selection test held on 16.9.1990 for the post of Supereme Court Master and to immediately appoint the per son selected therein against the vacancy falling in 25% selection quota. During, the pendency of the petition appointment orders of the candidates who had taken the examination in 1990 were issued. Since the petitioner had not been selected in the interview and no panel for successful candidates had been prepared as a result of the interview, the petitioner sought for an amendment in the writ petition by making an application which was allowed on 23.9.1992. In the amended writ petition, the petitioner had sought for issuance of a direction for quashing the notification dated 28.9.1999 to the extent to which it prescribed more than 12.5% marks for interview and the condition that only those candidates who secured 50% mark in the interview shall be considered qualified. A writ of mandamus was also sought for declaration of the select list of the candidates in the order of merit prepared on the basis of the aggregate of marks obtained in the written test and the interview held in pursuance to the notification dated 29.9.1990 and to appoint at least five persons out of the select list against five admitted vacancies for the selection quota notwithstanding the fact that selection process was started for filling up two vacancies which only were available at the relevant time of issue of notification dated 28.8.1990.  
 3. There are two directions made by the impugned judgment as under:-  
 4. It was conceded at the Bar by the learned counsel for the appellant that in so far as the direction No. 1 is concerned it has been accepted by the appellant and the appellant does not feel aggrieved thereby. The grievance of the appellant is confined to direction No.2.  
 5. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the Hon'ble the Chief Justice had directed only two vacancies in selection quota in the cadre of Supereme Court Master to be tilled; acting on which direction a notification inviting applications for appointment on the two posts was issued on 28.8.1990. A written test as contemplated by rules was held and the result announced on 7.8.1992. The candidates qualifying at the written test were called for interview held on 31.8.1992. The list of successful candidates was prepared accordingly. There were only two vacancies available on 28.8.1990. However, by the time the final selection was held on 31.8.1992 the number of vacancies available in selection quota was five. Inasmuch as the learned single Judge has directed the vacancies as available on the date when the final selection Was made to be filled up, the direction would result into five appointments being made though the entire process of selection from beginning to end was intended, initiated and finalised by keeping in view only two vacancies. It is also pointed out that as on 31.8.1992 there were 16 in-house candidates available in the feeding cadre holding the post of stenographers/assistants/senior translators as per list Annexure-A/2 (page 23 of the paperbook in LPA) who had become eligible for consideration for the post of Supereme Court Master on the basis of the Rules but they would be excluded from consideration inasmuch as the selection made on 31.8.1992 pursuant to the notification dated 28.8.1990 would result into five posts being filled up in accordance with the directions made by the learned single Judge though the process was intended and meant for filling up only two vacancies. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the direction made by  the learned single Judge is in consistent with the rules and has also resulted, into the right' of 16 incumbents above-said being excluded from the zone of consideration and has also caused serious prejudice to the appellant who would have had available before him a wider list of

eligible applicants to choose the Supereme Court Master to be selected. Learned
counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the law laid down repeatedly by the
Supreme Court and cited State of Bihar v. Secretariat Asstt Successful Examinees
Union, , Harjinder Singh Sodhi v. State of Punjab and Ors. , State of Bihar v. Madan Mohan Singh, 1994 Supp (3) SCC 308 and Prem
Prakash v. Union of India 1984 (Sup) SCC 687.
 6. In the case of State of Bihar v. Madan Mohan Singh (supra), the appellant Govt had invited applications on 29.9.1989 for filling up 32 vacancies. After conducting interview in November, 1990 a panel of 32 candidates was drawn up. On 24.11.1990, a resolution was passed that any further vacancy within one year would be filled up from the merit list already prepared. A question arose whether the appointments can be made from the panel already drawn up or fresh recruitment process was required to be resorted to for filling up future vacancies. Their Lordships held that the crucial question was whether, in fact, the advertisement and the initial decision taken was meant to fill up 32 vacancies only. It was held:
 7. In State of Bihar v. Secretariat Assistant Successful Examinees Union (supra) advertisement inviting applications for vacancies falling upto 1985-86 was issued in the year 1985. Examination was held in November, 1987 and the result published in July, 1990. The empanelled candidates who were left out after filling up vacancies upto 1985-86 approached the High Court seeking appointment against vacancies available on the date of the publication of the result as well as the vacancies arising upto 1991. The High Court allowed the prayer. In an appeal before the Supreme Court their Lordships held that the direction given by the High Court was not proper and could not be sustained.
 8. In Harjinder Singh Sodhl's case  their Lordship's have held that those who had sought for nomination to the post available in 1991 can be considered only for appointment to nine posts which arose in 1991 and could not be considered for selection for subsequent vacancies because that would have the effect of adversely affecting the candidates who became qualified later.
 9. Prem Parkash v. UOI,  also lends support to the same view. Two previously selected persons were sought to be appointed against vacancies occurring in a later year. Their Lordships held that this must be avoided because that results in ouster of two newly selected persons. Justice to one group at the expense

of injustice to another is perpetuation of injustice in some form or the other, held their Lordships.
 10. It is thus clear that selection and appointment to be made cannot exceed the number of vacancies notified.  
 11. On behalf of the respondent reliance was place on Umesh Chandra v. UOI,  and the subsequent directions given by the Supreme Court vide order dated 9.5.1986 in CMP 10751 of 1986 in the same matter (copy available on record), as also on a Division bench decision of this Court in J.N. Verma v. Hon'ble Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, CWP 2670/87 decided on 19.5.1992 (copy available on record). We have carefully perused the decisions so cited. However, none of them in our opinion helps the respondent.
 11.1 The main decision in Umesh Chandra's case  does not lay down any law or principle which may apply to the issue at hand. By the subsequent order dated 9.5.1986 passed in that case, their Lordships have given a direction to accommodate some candidates of the previous list of successful candidates against the available vacancies. The direction appears to have been given in the facts and circumstances of that case in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. No law or principle has been laid down to act as a precedent or be binding as the law laid down by the Supreme Court of India.
 11.2. The Division Bench decision of Delhi High Court in J.N. Verma's case is clearly distinguishable inasmuch as the number of vacancies available at the tune when the selection process was initiated was not specified and the Selection Committee had prepared at list of the successful candidates. The Division Bench has held:  
 Consequently, when the matter was placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice, His Lordship had on 11.9.1985 directed that steps be taken up immediately to fill up all the vacancies which are at present lying vacant. Keeping in view the order of the Chief Justice the Division Bench has further held:  
 11.3. It is, therefore clear that in the case of J.N. Verma the selection was not
against a specified number of vacancies. A panel of selected candidates was in
tended to be prepared so as to make available suitable candidates to fill up vacancies
as and when they occur. Thus the selection process was initiated and meant for filling up vacancies in contemplation. Such is not the case at hand. On the contrary,
the fore quoted extracts go to support the case of the appellant before us rather
than the respondent's.   
 11.4 None of the decisions relied by the learned counsel for the respondent has application to the case at hand.   
 12. The case at hand relates to appointment against the vacancies in the Registry which is a subject matter lying exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice under Article 229 of the Consititution. The Selection Process was initiated under the order of the Chief Justice for filling up of two vacancies only. At no point of time Hon'ble the Chief Justice has directed any vacancy beyond two to be filled up from out of the candidates selected.  
 13. Under Article 229 of the Constitution appointments of officers and servants of a
High Court shall be made by the Chief Justice of the Court or such other Judge or
Officer of the Court as he may direct. The object of this Article is to secure the independence of the High Court. The Constitution confers exclusive jurisdiction on the
Chief justice so far as the appointment of officers and servants of a High Court is
concerned. No appointment may be made unless sanctioned or ordered by the
Chief justice. It is true that an action of the Chief Justice acting on the administrative side is subject to judicial review in exercise of the writ jurisdiction of the High
Court which is saved by Article 226 of the Constitution. But a clear and well de
fined distinction exists between judicially reviewing an action of the Chief Justice
where he has acted and directing a Chief Justice to act in a particular manner
when he has not yet acted. In the case at hand, the Chief Justice had directed only two
appointments to be made. By directing the Chief Justice to make five appointments instead of two where the Chief Justice was neither constitutionally nor legally
obliged to make such number of appointments, in our opinion amounts to exceeding
the limits of judicial review and transgressing upon the constitutional power of the
Chief Justice.   
 14. The direction made by the learned single Judge cannot be sustained for several reasons. Firstly, such a direction would tantamount to usurping the power which the Constitution has chosen to vest exclusively in the Chief Justice. Secondly, it is not

in conformity with the law laid down by the Supreme Court consistently in the cases referred to hereinabove. Thirdly, the selection process initiated in the year 1990 for only two vacancies had a limited zone of consideration by including therein a limited number of employees, eligible till then; while a selection process initiated with five vacancies would have provided a wider zone of consideration from amongst the eligible employees by reference to the date on which 5 vacancies became available. The right of employees to be considered for selection who had become eligible by the time five vacancies became available has been taken away for no fault of theirs. Fourthly, the right of the employer i.e. the High Court to have a wider number of eligible candidates to choose from has been prejudiced.  
 15. The appeal deserves to be allowed.  
 16. After the hearing in the appeal was closed on 26.10.1998, on the next day, the respondent moved an application seeking re-hearing of the appeal submitting that CM 2389/97 filed by the respondent was to be taken up for hearing along with the hearing in the appeal itself but the same has escaped his attention and in the interest of justice he should be heard on the application. The prayer was allowed and we have additionally heard the learned counsel for the parties on the application.  
 17. By CM 2389/97 the respondent proposed to invite the attention of the court to the fact that subsequent to the passing of the impugned order by the learned single Judge the appellant itself has been following the policy of making appointments out of panel and beyond the number of vacancies available on the date of initiation of the selection process. He submitted that as the appellant itself has adopted such policy or practice, there is no justification for the appellant pursuing this appeal.  
 18. This prayer has been vehemently opposed by the learned counsel for the appellant submitting that there was not such practice being followed by the appellant. It was pointed out that the singular instance which has been cited by the respondent in his application relates to a case where the Hon'ble Chief Justice had asked for recommendation of a committee of Judges and specifically directed such vacancies to be filled up against which appointments were made. Such a single instance cannot in any case be said to be a 'practise followed' by the appellant benefit whereof may be claimed by the respondent. Apart from this we are clearly of the opinion that if in any stray incident something has been done in departure from the law or even a practice not supportable in law was followed that cannot provide a ground for raising an argument that the respondent should also be allowed or should have been allowed the benefit of an appointment in excess of notified vacancies. We have to decide the case in accordance with law and determine the rights and obligations of the parties consistently therewith.  
 19. We may place on record that as against the vacancies of  1995, the respondent has participated in the process of selection which was initiated subsequent to the impugned proceedings. He has been selected and appointed in the year 1997. He is contesting the present appeal for the purpose of seeking an appointment from a back date which, as already stated, we have found to be not permissble.
 20. The appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment in so far as it directs the appellant to make appointment against the vacancies available on the date when final se
lection was made is set aside. Instead, it is directed that the appointment shall
remain confined to the two vacancies available on the date of notification i.e.
29.8.1990. No order as to costs.   
 21. Though the appeal has been disposed of, before parting we would like to make an observation of our own. We find Hon'ble the Chief Justice having been imp leaded as party to the litigation for which there was no occasion much less a justification. Only the High Court should have been joined as a party to be represented by the Registrar. The tendency on the part of the writ petitioners so impleading Hon'ble the Chief Justice has to be deprecated.

(1) This writ petition is directed against the order of the Delhi Administration passed on the 28th November, 1968 under section 10(1)(c) and 12(5) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, (hereinafter called 'the Act'), copy of which being annexure 'A' to the writ petition, referring to the Labour Court at Delhi, presided over by Shri R. K. Baweja, the following industrial dispute :    ""WHETHERthe non-employment of Shri Ajab Singh is unjustified and/or illegal and if so, to what relief is he entitied ?""   
 (11) In our anxiety to understand precisely what the Supreme Court meant I studied the whole of their decision and also the Gujarat High Court decision reported in (1965) 2 Llj 268, which was reversed by the Supreme Court. At page 271 of the report of the Gujarat High Court judgment it is stated that respondent No. 3 had made a complaint to his Union, respondent No. 2, who thereupon presented the demand to the Corporation for the reinstatement of respondent No. 3. But the Supreme Court has held that the evidence before the Tribunal clearly showed that no such demand was made by the workmen concerned or by the Union on the Management of the Sindhu Resettlement Corporation and I feel bound to accept this latter position. The Supreme Court has also clarified that even if the Conciliation Officer found that an industrial dispute existed and so reported to the Government, this could nto be regarded as the existence of the industrial dispute which has to be founded upon a demand by the workmen on the employers. If this is the ratio of the Supreme Court decision, it cannto be said that an industrial dispute existed in the present ease as no demand was made by respondent No. 3 on the petitioner-company before he made an application under Section 10(2) for reference. In that event the fact that the demand of respondent No. 3 was forwarded by the Conciliation Officer to the petitioner-company and was nto accepted by the latter would nto constitute an industrial dispute. The observation in Standard Coal Company v. S.P. Verma in paragraph (15), that ""where workers may consider it wholly useless to make a demand on the management and prefer to move the appropriate machinery set up by the Government for the redress of their grievances, .......it will be an industrial dispute"" may nto be correct if it is opposed to the above Supreme Court decision. In Goody ear (India) Limited v. Industrial Tribunal Rajasthan, Jaipur Mehta J., purported to distinguish the decision of the Supreme Court in S.R. Corporation v. Industrial Tribunal, referred to above, on the ground that in the case before him the employee had made an application to the Conciliation Officer challenging the termination of his services and requesting for reinstatement and the employer opposed the reinstatement. The learned Judge did nto consider that in the Supreme Court case also the application to the conciliation Officer had been made. In accordance with the usual procedure the comments of the employer on the said application might have been called for by the Conciliation Officer and at this stage the employer may have opposed the demand for reinstatement. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held that no industrial dispute regarding reinstatement existed. We have re-examined our decision in the Management of M/s. Toshimwal Bros. Pvt. Ltd. v. Lt. Governor, Delhi, referred to above, dismissing the appeal against the decision of Kapur J. in that case(l). We find that in that case a demand by some workmen including all the workmen of the subordinate staff had at first been made on the Management and was refused by the Management. That dispute was nto referred to industrial adjudication. Inasmuch as it had nto been supported by a substantial number of workmen, but later the same industrial dispute in respect of the subordinate staff"" only was referred to industrial adjudication as between the management and the subordinate staff only. The subordinate staff did nto repeat their demands to the management again before the reference was made. But the demand of the subordinate staff was included in the first demand made by them and some others on the Management. In that case, therefore, an industrial dispute between the subordinate staff and the management had come into existence before the said industrial dispute was referred to adjudication by the management. It is nto quite clear if the following observation of Mack, J. in Kandan Textile Limited v. Industrial Tribunal Madras,takes the view that a demand nto directly made on the Management could be made on the Labour Commissioner and would still constitute an industrial dispute. The observation is as follows :-    ""THISmay have been in law an industrial dispute brought as it was to the notice of the Government by one of its responsible officers, which would have justified a reference to a Tribunal of a dispute of very limited scope.""
 (12) We are of the view that the decision of the Supreme Court in S.R. Corporation v. Industrial Tribunal, Gujarat, referred to above, has finally established the proposition that a demand by the workmen must be raised first on the Management and rejected bythem before an industrial dispute can be said to arise and exist and that the making of such a demand to the Conciliation Officer and its communication by him to the Management, who reject the same is nto sufficient to consitute an industrial dispute. The decision and dicta of some of the High Court to the contrary can no longer be considered good law.     
 (3)It is clear that section 2-A enables the Government to refer to adjudication an industrial dispute between an individual workman and his employer. The previous view that an industrial dispute must be between the employer on the one side and the workmen collectively on the other side or at any rate the dispute of an individual workman must be sponsored collectively by the other workmen to constitute an industrial dispute is to that extent superseded by legislation. It is true that the insertion of section 2-A in the Act was nto accompanied by consequential changes in the Act to make it clear that even a dispute between a single workman and the employer can constitute an industrial dispute. But the relevant provision in the Act referring to ""workmen"" would henceforth have to be construed as including ""workman"", so that section 2-A is harmonised with the rest of the provision of the Act. At any rate section 2-A being a later provision is in no danger of being impliedly repealed by the older provisions. The implied repeal can only be of an older provision by a later provision. Further, the expression ""industrial dispute"" as used in entry 29 of the Concurrent Legislative List in the Government of India Act, 1935 was nto based on any judicial decisions construing the said expression as relating only to a dispute between the workmen collectively and their employer. It cannto be said, therefore, that the use of the said expression in the Act necessarily meant a dispute between the employer and the workmen collectively. Entry 22 of the Concurrent List of the Constitution, therefore, did nto use the said expression as being restricted to disputes of workmen collectively. Parliament was, therefore, competent to enact Section 2-A under entry 22 of the Concurrent List of the Constitution. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that entry 22 of the Concurrent List was nto wide enough to include the dispute of an individual workman with his employer, Parliament could legislate about such an individual dispute under the residuary entry 97 of the Union List read with Article 248 of the Constitution, on the ground that the subject fell outside the Concurrent List and the State List of the Constitution and the Parliament had, therefore, unrestricted power to legislate upon it. This contention has therefore, no substance.  
 (4)The claim of respondent No. 3 in annexure 'D' is for the setting aside of the retrenchment and for the reinstatement. According to his learned counsel it is covered by items 3 and 6 of the Second Schedule and item 10 of the Third Schedule of the Act. The learned counsel for the petitioner, however, contends that the word ""non-employment"" used in the reference is vague. This argument overlooks the fact that the very definition of ""industrial dispute"" in section 2(k) of the Act says that the dispute or difference which is connected with ""the employment or non-employment"" is an industrial dispute. The word ""nonemployment"" would, therefore, include retrenchment as well as refusal to reinstate, which is the grievance of respondent No. 3. We are fortified in this view by the decision of the Federal Court in Western India Automobile Association v. Industrial Tribunal, Bombay, and the Gujarat High Court decision in Sindhu Resettlement Corporation v. Industrial Tribunal, which was nto reversed by the Supreme Court on this point.
 (13) For the above reasons, we quash and set aside the order of reference dated 28-11-1968, copy iof which is at annexure 'A' to the writ petition, and direct the Labour Court, Delhi, presided over by Shri R. K.. Baweja nto to entertain the same. We make no order as to costs.

S. SAGHIR AHMAD, J.
     Whether  the   Haryana  Housing   Board  is   a  ""Local
Authority"" within  the meaning	of  Section  32(iv)  of	 the
Payment of  Bonus Act, 1965 is the question to be decided in
these appeals. If it is held that it is a ""Local Authority"",
this Act,  namely, the Payment of Bonus Act, would not apply
to its	employees, as  it is provided in Section 32(iv) that
it  would   not	 apply	to  those  categories  of  employees
(including  the	  employees  of	  the	""Local	 Authority"")
enumerated, specified and categorised therein.
     Incidentally, ""Local  authority"" has  also been defined
in Section  2(J) of  the Haryana  Housing Board Act, 1971 as
under:
     ""(J)   'Local    authority'   means    a
     municipality   constituted	  under	  the
     Punjab Municipal Act, 1911 (Punjab Act 3
     of	  1911),    or	 a   Gram   Panchayat
     constituted  under	  the	Punjab	 Gram
     Panchayat Act,  1952 (Punjab  Act	4  of
     1953), or	a Panchayat Samity or a Zilla
     Parishad constituted  under  the  Punjab
     Panchayat Samities	 and  Zilla  Parishad
     Act, 1961	(Punjab Act 3 of 1961), or an
     Improvement Trust	Improvement under the
     Punjab Act 4 of 1922).""
     Both the  definitions are conclusive in nature and only
those  bodies  including  the  Municipal  Board	 or  a	Gram
Panchayat etc.	Will be	 treated as ""Local authority"" as are
mentioned therein.  But there is a significant difference in
as much	 as the	 words ""Authority  legally  entitled  to  or
entrusted by  the Government with, the control or management
of a  Municipal or  Local  Fund""  which	 are  found  in	 the
definition contained  in the  General Clauses  Act  are	 not
found in  the definition of ""Local Authority"" in the Haryana
Housing Board Act, 1971.
     Concept of ""Local Authority"" is also found contained in
Entry 5, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution
which provided as under:
     The Entry	empowers the  State Legislature	 to make law
with respect  to any  subject relating	to Local  Government
including the constitution of ""Local Authorities"". The State
Legislature  can  also	confer	such  powers  as  it  itself
possesses upon	a ""Local  Authority"", including the power of
taxation (within  the limits of List II) for the purposes of
Local Self  Government. The  ""Local Authority"", undoubtedly,
is   a	 representative	  body	 but   notwithstanding	 its
representative	character,   it	  remains   a	sub-ordinate
Authority created  by a	 statute and,  therefore, it  cannot
claim the  power of  taxation  which  belong  to  the  State
Legislature except  to the extent it is conferred upon it by
the statute which creates it.
     The Municipal  Committees, the  District  Boards,	Gram
Panchayats and Panchayat Samitis etc. represent the units of
Local Self  Government where  people of	 a local area govern
themselves through  their elected representatives in respect
of a  large number  of	matters	 including  construction  of
buildings, roads,  parks,  lighting  of	 streets,  sewerage,
conservancy  and   water  works	  etc.	These	Local	Self
Governments, namely,  the Municipal  Boards and the District
Board etc.  are constituted under statutory provisions which
elaborately provide who, on being elected, become members of
the Municipal Boards or the District Board. These Boards are
basically independents bodies with very little or minimal of
Government control  and that  too in the limited field. They
formulate their	 own policies  and implement  those policies
through the machinery provided under law. They have power to
levy Panchayat, municipal or other local taxes and have also
the power to realise those taxes through coercive processes,
if they	 are not  paid immediately on demand. They have also
the right to raise, built up and manage their ""local funds"".
     Under the	basic principle of statutory interpretation,
the words  ""Other Authority"",  having  been  placed  in	 the
company of ""Municipal Council"" and ""District Boards"" etc. in
the definition	of ""Local  Authority"" in the General Clauses
Act  can   be  interpreted  to	mean  a	 ""Body""	 having	 and
possessing, practically	 all the  attributes of	 a Municipal
Board or  the District	Board so  far as  their	 independent
existence is concerened.
     Similarly, in  the definition  of ""Local  Authority"" in
the Haryana  Housing Board  Act, 1971,	it has been provided
that  it  shall	 mean  the  Municipality,  Gram	 Panchayats,
Panchayat Samitis, Zila Parishads and Improvement Trusts.
It hardly requires to be mentioned that the Municipal Board,
the  Gram  Panchayat  or  a  Panchayat	Samiti	or  a  Zilla
Parishad, or for that matter, Improvement Trust, referred to
in this	 definition are, at least, partially, if not wholly,
elected bodies.
 In Municipal  Corporation	of  Delhi  v.  Birla  Cotton
Spinning  and  Weaving	Mills,	Delhi  and  Anr.  (1968	 (3)
S.C.R.251), Hidayatullah,J.  (as he  then was  ) observed as
under:
 In Valjibhai  Muljibhai Soney  and Anr. v. The State of
Bombay (New  Gujarat) and  Ors. (1964  (3) S.C.R.  686)	 the
State Trading  Corporation  was	 held  not  to	be  a  local
authority within the meaning of Section 3(31) of the General
Clauses Act.
 The aforesaid  two cases  came to be considered by this
Court in  Union of  India and  Ors. v.	R.C. Jain  and	Ors.
(1981) (2)  S.C.R. 854)	 in which  the question	 whether the
Development Authority  created under  the Delhi	 Development
Act, 1957  was a  ""local authority""  within the	 meaning  of
Section 32(iv)	of the	Payment of  Bonus Act  or  not,	 was
involved and on a consideration of all the attributes of the
Delhi Development  Authority, it  was held  to be  a  ""local
authority"". This  Court speaking through O. Chinnappa Reddy,
J. observed as under:
     ""What   then    are   the	  distinctive
     attributes and  characteristics, all  or
     many of  which a Municipal Commissioners
     shares with  any other  local authority?
     First,   the   authorities	  must	 have
     separate legal  existence	as  corporate
     bodies.   They    must   not   be	 mere
     governmental  agencies   but   must   be
     legally independant entities. Next, they
     must  ordinarily,	 wholly	 or   partly,
     directly or  indirectly, be  elected  by
     the inhabitants  of the area. Next, they
     must enjoy a certain degree of autonomy,
     with freedom  to decide  for  themselves
     questions of  policy affecting  the area
     administered by  them. The degree of the
     dependents may vary considerably but, an
     appreciable measure  of  autonomy	there
     must be. Next, they must be entrusted by
     statute with such governmental functions
     and duties	 as are	 usually entrusted by
     statute with such governmental functions
     and duties	 as are	 usually entrusted to
     municipal	 bodies,    such   as	those
     connected with  providing	amenities  to
     the inhabitants  of the  locality,	 like
     health and education services, water and
     sewerage, town planning and development,
     roads, markets,  transportation,  social
     welfare services  etc.etc.	 Broadly,  we
     may say  that they may be entrusted with
     the  performance  of  civic  duties  and
     functions	which	would  otherwise   be
     governmental   duties   and   functions.
     Finally, they  must have  the  power  to
     raise funds for the furtherance of their
     activites and  the fulfilment  of	their
     projects  by   levying   taxes,   rates,
     charges,  or   fees.  This	  may  be  in
     addition	to    monies   provided	   by
     government or  obtained by	 borrowing or
     otherwise. What  is  essential  is	 that
     control or	 management of	the fund must
     vest in the authority.""
     Since  this   decision  will   equally  apply   to	 the
definition of  ""Local Authority""  set  out  in	the  Haryana
Housing Board  Act, 1971 as that definition is substantially
similar to  the	 definition  of	 ""Local	 Authority""  in	 the
General Clauses	 Act, it  is  in  the  light  of  the  above
principals that	 it has	 to  be	 seen  whether	the  Haryana
Housing Board  answers the  attributes specified above so as
to be  treated a  ""local authority""  within the	 meaning  of
Section 32(iv) of the Payment of Bonus Act.
 The Haryana  Housing Board	 Act, 1971  in its  preamble
states that  it is  ""an Act  to provide	 for measures  to be
taken  to   deal  with	and  satisfy  the  need	 of  housing
accommodation.""
     The Statement  of ""Objects	 and Reasons"" set out at the
time of introduction of the Bill in the Legislative Assembly
indicate, inter alia, as under:
     The Haryana  Housing Board	 (for Short, 'the Board' has
been established  and constituted under Section 3 of the Act
which, inter  alia, provides  that the Board shall be a body
corporate having  perpetual succession and a common seal and
shall have  the	 power	to  acquire,  hold,  administer	 and
transfer property,  movable or	immovable, and to enter into
contracts.
     Sub-section (4)  of Section  3 provided  that the Board
shall consist  of a Chairman, a Chief Administrator and such
other Members,	not more that 12 and not less that 6, as the
State Government  may, from  time to  time, by	Notification
appoint. Unider	 Section 5  of the Act, the State Government
has the	 power to  grant such  leave to the Chairman and the
Chief Administrator  as may  be admissible to them under the
Rules made under the Act.
 Section 7 provides that every Member of the Board shall
hold office for a period of three years from the date of his
appointment and	 shall be paid such salary and allowances as
may be	prescribed. Conditions	of service are also required
to be  prescribed by  Rules made  under the  Act. It is also
provided in this Section that on the expiry of the term of 3
years,	a  Member  shall  be  eligible	for  re-appointment.
Section 7-A indicates that the Chairman, Chief Administrator
and other Members of the Boards shall hold office during the
pleasure of the State Government.
 Section 14	 provides for the appointment of one or more
committees for	any particular	local area  for	 purpose  of
discharging such  duties or performing such functions of the
Board as  may be  delegated to	them with  due regard to the
circumstances and requirements of that area.
 Chapter III of the Act deals with the Housing Schemes.
Section 20 provides as under:
     The exercise  of power  by the  Board  in	framing	 and
executing  Housing  Schemes  is	 not  only  subject  to	 the
provisions of the Act but also subject to the control of the
State Government.
     The matters  which may  be provided  for in  a  Housing
Scheme are  indicated in  Section 21 which include laying or
re-laying of  the land,	 construction and re-construction of
buildings, construction	 and alteration	 of streets and back
lanes, drainage,  water supply	and  lighting  of  the	area
included in  the Scheme,  Parks,  playing  fields'  sanitary
arrangements etc.
     The accounts  of the  Board are  to be  audited by such
persons as  are deputed	 by the	 Government (See sub-section
(2) of	Section 61)  and the Board does not seem to have any
choice in  the matter  except to submit its accounts to that
person. The Board has also to comply with such directions as
may be	issued to it by the State Government after a perusal
of the	auditor's report.  Special audit may also be made of
the Board's  accounts under  the  directions  of  the  State
Government.
     Other statutory  provisions indicating  control of	 the
State Government over the Board are contained in Sections 71
and 72 of the Act relevant portions of which are re-produced
below:
     The matters  which may  be provided  for in  a  Housing
Scheme are  indicated in  Section 21 which include laying or
re-laying of  the land,	 construction and re-construction of
buildings, construction	 and alteration	 of streets and back
lanes, drainage,  water supply	and  lighting  of  the	area

     The accounts  of the  Board are  to be  audited by such
persons as  are deputed	 by the	 Government (See sub-section
(2) of	Section 61)  and the Board does not seem to have any
choice in  the matter  except to submit its accounts to that
person. The Board has also to comply with such directions as
my be  issued to  it by the State Government after a perusal
of the	auditor's report.  Special audit may also be made of
the Board's  accounts under  the  directions  of  the  State
Government.
     Other statutory  provisions indicating  control of	 the
State Government over the Board are contained in Sections 71
and 72 of the Act relevant portions of which are re-produced
below:
     Chapter IV	 deals with  the acquisition and disposal of
land. Chapter  VII deals  with the Board's finance, accounts
and audit.  Section 56	provides that the Board shall have a
fund called  the Housing  Board Fund  which shall consist of
all moneys  received by	 or behalf  of the Board as also all
proceeds of  land or  any other kind of property sold by the
Board, including  all rents,  interest,	 profits  and  other
moneys accruing	 to the Board which has also been authorised
by sub-section	(2) to	accept grants,	donations and  gifts
from the  Central Government  or the  State Government	or a
local  authority   or  any   individual	 or   body,  whether
incorporated or	 not, for all or any of the purposes of this
Act.
     Section 72A  provides for appeals against orders passed
by the	officers of  the Board	or the Chairman. Section 72B
which provides	for a  revision to the State Government lays
dow as under:
     The above	provisions clearly  spell out that the Board
which is  basically and essentially a creation of the Act of
State Legislature consists of persons appointed by the State
Government on  salary basis.  The Board's  personnel are not
elected by  the people	and there  is no element of people's
choice being  represented in  any manner in the constitution
of  the	 Board.	 The  Board  functions	strictly  under	 the
supervision and control of the State Government and does not
hold or possess a ""local fund"". What constitutes the fund of
the Board has already been specified above.
     These functions  as are  indicated in  a Housing Scheme
are essentially	 performed by  Municipal Boards or Municipal
Council which,	undoubtedly, are  ""Local Authorities"" but on
that analogy  the Haryana Housing Board cannot be treated to
be a ""local authority"" as the extent of control of the State
Government under  which the  Board has	to  function  is  so
prominently pervasive  that it	is almost destructive of its
independence which  will also be apparent from the fact that
in the matter of settlement of its Annual Programmes, Budget
and Establishment  schedule, the  Board has  to	 obtain	 the
sanction of  the State	Government under  Section 24  of the
Act. The  supplementary budget	and programme,	if any,	 has
also to be sanctioned by the State Government.
     We need not refer to other provisions as the provisions
already referred  to above  are sufficient to bring home the
point that  Haryana Housing  Board does	 not have  even	 the
semblance of  independence which  are normally	possessed by
local self  Governments, like  Municipal Boards	 or District
Boards etc.  The Board	also does not even partially consist
of elected representatives of the people.
     The Board,	 no doubt, has the power to levy and realise
Betterment Charges (See Section 40 to Section 43 of the Act)
and various  amount of	money due from presons in possession
of the	properties of  the Boards  by way  of rent  etc. are
recoverable as arrears of land revenue but that by itself is
not sufficient	to clothe  the Board  with the	status of  a
""local authority"".
     It	 is   contended	 by  the  learned  counsel  for	 the
appellant that	since it  has already  been provided in sub-
section (3)  of Section	 3 of the Haryana Housing Board Act,
1971 that  for purposes	 of this  Act, namely,	the  Haryana
Housing Board  shall be deemed to be a ""Local Authority"", it
cannot but  be treated	to be  a ""Local	 Authority"" with the
consequence that  it is	 not liable  to	 pay  bonus  to	 its
employees as  it would	squarely fall  within the exceptions
set out in Section 32(iv) of the Payment of Bonus Act. We do
not agree.
     Sub-section (3) of Section 3 provides as under:
     Explanation- The  purpose	of  this  Act
     referred to  in sub-section  (3) include
     the management and use of lands
     and building  belonging to or vesting in
     the Board	under or  for the purposes of
     this Act  ant the exercise of its rights
     over and  with respect to such lands and
     buildings for the purposes of this Act.""
     It will  be seen  that the Legislature itself has given
the Board  limited status  of ""Local  Authority only for the
purpose of  Land Acquisition  Act as  also the	parent	Act,
namely, the Haryana Housing Board Act, 1971, under which the
Board has  been constituted and established. The Legislature
has given  this status	only fictionally  as the  Board,  in
reality, is  not a ""Local Authority"" and that too only for a
limited purposes. The Legislature could well have given this
status to the Board for purpose of other Acts also including
the  Payment  of  Bonus	 Act  but  this	 has  not  done	 and
consequently the Board cannot, specially in view of what has
been stated  above, be	treated as  ""local authority"", under
the Payment of Bonus Act.
     There does	 not, therefore,  appear to be any reason to
differ from  the view  expressed by the learned Single Judge
or by  the Division  Bench (in	appeal )  of the  Punjab and
Haryana High Court that the Board is not a ""local authority""
     It	 will	be  relevant   to  point   out	the  further
observations of the Supereme Court as under:
     Thus, the	decision that  the Mines  Board was  a local
authority was  not disputed. In any case, this Court, on the
basis of  relevant statutory  provisions specially  that the
Board has  power to levy taxes and other assessments and has
got its	 own fund,  found it to be a local authority. It may
be pointed  out	 that  the  decision  was  rendered  not  in
connection with	 the provision	of Payment  of Bonus Act but
under provisions of the Representation of people Act to find
out whether  an office	of profit under the State Government
was held by the respondent.
     Learned counsel  for the  appellant then cited Kendriya
Nagrik Samiti, Kanpur and other vs. Jal Sansthan, Kanpur and
others (AIR  1982 Allahabad  406) in  which it was held that
Jal Sansthan  constituted by  the State Government under the
U.P. Water  Supply and Sewerage Act, 43 of 1975 was a ""Local
Authority"", although,  the Court  had also found it to be an
instrumentality of  the State  Government.  The	 High  Court
noticed that  Jal Sansthan as defined in Section 2(9) of the
Act meant  ""a  Local  Authority	 constituted  by  the  State
Government under  Section 18  to perform its functions under
the Act	 in one	 or more local areas"" and on account of this
definition,  the   High	 Court,	  after	 referring   to	 the
definition of  the ""Local Authority"" in Section 4(25) of the
U.P. General  Clauses Act,  held that  Jal  Sansthan  was  a
""Local Authority""  which was  to  be  treated  at  par	with
Municipal Corporation  etc. for	 the purposes of Local Self-
Government. It	may be	pointed out that under Section 18 of
the Act,  Jal Sansthan	consists of,  amongst others,  three
Sabhasads of  the Nagar	 Mahapalika nominated  by the  State
Government.  Sabhasads,	 under	the  U.P.  Nagar  Mahapalika
Abhihiyam, Municipal Corporation.
 Learned counsel  for the appellant also relied upon the
decision of  Mahavir and others vs. State of u.p. and others
AIR 1979 Allahabad 3 in which Mandi Samiti constituted under
the U.P.  Krishi Utpadan  Mandi Adhiniyam  was held  to be a
Local Authority for purposes of Land Acquisition Act.
     Significantly, Section  12(2) of the Adhiniyam contains
a deeming  provision that  ""the Committee  shall Acquisition
Act, 1894  and any  other law  for the time being in force"".
(Emphasis  supplied).	This  case  is,	 therefore,  clearly
distinguishable.
 Our attention  was next  drawn to	the decision  of the
Mysore High  Court in  Workmen of  Mangalore Port  Trust vs.
Management of  the Mangalore  Port and	Ors. (1973 Lab. I.C.
1536) in  which Board  of Trustees  of the Port of Mangalore
was held  to be	 a ""Local  Authority"" within  the meaning of
Section 32(iv)	of the	Payment of  Bonus Act. The Judges of
the Mysore  High Court	relied upon the definition of ""Local
Authority"" contained  in Section 3(31) of the General Clause
Act in	which the  Municipal Committee, District Board and a
Body  of  Port	Commissioners  are  indicated  to  be  Local
Authorities  and  then	they  observed	that  there  was  no
difference between  the Body  of Port  Commissioners and the
Board of  Trustees of  the Port of Mangalore and, therefore,
the letter  has also to be treated as the ""Local Authority"".
They also  relied upon the decision of the Madras High Court
in Official  Assignee of  Madras vs. Trustees of the Port of
Trust, Madras (AIR 1936 Madras 789) in which the Trustees of
the Port  Trust, Madras,  on account  of the  definition  of
""Local Authority"". A decision of the Calcutta High Court in
Manoranjan Das	vs. Commissioner  Presidency  Division	(AIR
1970 Calcutta  179) which  was cited  before us	 also by the
learned counsel	 for the  appellant, was  considered by	 the
Mysore High  Court and	it was	noticed	 by  them  that	 the
Calcutta High Court held that since the Calcutta Dock Labour
Board had to control and manage its fund which a local fund,
it was a ""Local Authority"" within the meaning of the General
Clauses Act.  This decision is, therefore, of no help to the
appellant as  the concept regarding control and management a
""Local Fund""  is outside  the scope  of	 the  definition  of
""Local Authority"" in the Haryana Housing Board Act, 1971.
 A decision	 of the	 Andhra Pradesh	 High Court in Budha
Veerinaidu vs.	State of  Andhra Pradesh  and Anr.  (143 ITR
1021) has  been cited  to indicate  that Agricultural Market
Committee functioning  under the (Andra Pradesh Agricultural
Produce and  Live Stock)  Markets Act,1966  was held to be a
""Local Authority""  as it was found that the Market Committee
was  entrusted	by  the	 Government  with  the	control	 and
management  of	 ""Local	 Fund"".	  This	decision   is	also
distinguishable on  the	 ground	 that  definition  of  Local
Authority in  the Haryana  Housing Board  Act, 1971 does not
refer to entrustment, control or management of ""Local Fund"".
 In	 12,   I.C.  Bose   Road  Tenants'  Association	 vs.
Collector of  Howrah and  Ors. (AIR 1977 Calcutta 437) which
was next  cited before us, it was not disputed that Calcutta
Metropolitan Development  Authority was	 a ""Local Authority""
     Learned counsel for the appellant lastly contended that
the Haryana  Housing Board  being an instrumentality  of the
Government or,	in any	case, being  a statutory  body is an
""Authority""  within   the  meaning  of	Article	 12  of	 the
Constitution and  since Local  Authorities  have  also	been
referred to  in article 12, the Board Should also be treated
as a Local Authority. The argument is fallacious.
 Article 12 provides as under:
     This Article  contains the	 definition of ""State"" which
is an  inclusive  definition  and  includes  Government	 and
Parliament of  India, Government and the Legislature of each
of the State as also all local or other Authorities. Article
12 does	 not define  ""Local Authority""	but defines ""State"".
The attempt  of the  learned counsel for the appellant in to
invoke	the   rule  of	 ejusdem  generis  which  cannot  be
permitted.
 When particular  words pertaining	to a  class of genus
are followed  by general  words,  the  latter,	namely,	 the
general words are construed as limited to things of the same
kind as	 those	specified    (See:  Kavalappara	 Kottarathil
Kochuni vs.  State of  Madras,	AIR  1960  SC  1080;  Thakur
Amarasinghji vs.  State of Rajasthan, AIR 1955 SC 504). This
is known  as the  rule	of  ejusdem  generis  reflecting  an
attempt to  reconcile incompatibility  between the  specific
and general  words (Tribhuwan  Parkash Nayyar  vs. Union  of
India, AIR 1970 SC 540).
 This Court	 in Amar  Chandra vs.  Collector of  Excise,
Tripura, AIR  1972 SC  1863 laid  down that the rule applies
when ""(1)  the statute	contains an  enumeration of specific
words; (2) the subjects of enumeration constitute a class or
category; (3) that class or category is not exhausted by the
enumeration; (4)  the general  terms follow the enumeration;
and (5)	 there is  no indication  of a different legislative
intent"".
     Thus, it  is essential  for application  of the ejusdem
generis rule that enumerated things before the general words
must constitute	 a category  or a  genus. It was, therefore,
pointed out  by Lord  Simonds in  Russel vs.  Scott (1948  2
AII.E.R. 1  (HL)) that	""indeed if  a collection of items is
heterogeneous, it  almost seems	 a conflict  in words to say
that they belong to the same genus"".
     While interpreting the definitions of ""Local Authority""

Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.          The appellant, appointed as an Assistant Director of Physical Education in

Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, claimed revised pay scales at Rs. 550-900

w.e.f. 14.7.1979, Rs.700-1600 w.e.f. 1.4.1980, Rs. 2200-4000 w.e.f. 1.1.1986 and

Rs.3000-5000 w.e.f. 14.7.1987. His request for grant of the said revised pay scales was

rejected by the University by communication dated 10.04.1991. The said rejection

was challenged by the appellant in Civil Writ Petition No.4262 of 1992 in the High

Court of Punjab and Haryana. The writ petition was dismissed on 05.08.1992. The

appellant challenged the decision of the High Court in Special Leave Petition (C)

No.16068 of 1992. This Court dismissed the SLP.
2.        The appellant thereafter started a second round of litigation. He

approached the Civil Court(Additional Civil Judge(Sr.Division), Rohtak) in Civil Suit

No.194 of 1993 for a declaration that the University's action issuing letter dated

10.04.1991 refusing the revision of pay scales was illegal, null and void and for a
                                            2

direction awarding pay scales of Rs. 550-900 w.e.f. 14.7.1979, Rs.700-1600 w.e.f.

1.4.1980, Rs. 2000-4000 w.e.f. 1.1.1986 and Rs.3000-5000 w.e.f. 14.7.1987. On

contest, by a considered judgment the said suit was dismissed on 09.09.2002.

3.         During the pendency of the suit a representation filed by the appellant was

considered by the Executive Council of the University and a resolution was passed on

20.08.1997 acceding to the request of the appellant for grant of the said pay scales Rs.

550-900 w.e.f. 15.11.1979, Rs.700-1600 w.e.f. 1.4.1980, Rs. 2200-4000 w.e.f. 1.1.1986

and Rs.3000-5000 w.e.f. 14.7.1987. But as there was no representative of the State

Government present in the said meeting and as the prior approval of the State

Government had not been granted, the resolution was not given effect having regard

to the Section 9F and 11A of the Maharshi Dayanand University Act, 1975. There is

no dispute that the resolution was not given effect. Apparently that is why the

appellant neither sought withdrawal of the suit on the ground that the resolution was

passed accepting his request nor sought amendment raising any additional ground

that the University had accepted his claim. He proceeded with the suit and as stated

above the suit ended in dismissal on 09.09.2002. Not being satisfied, the appellant

challenged the dismissal of the suit by filing an appeal before the Additional District

Judge, Rohtak. The said appeal (Civil Appeal No.96 of 2002/2003) was dismissed on

05.09.2003. The appellant did not challenge the said dismissal of the appeal and the

said dismissal thus attained finality.
4.         Thereafter, the appellant commenced the third round of litigation. He filed

another Writ Petition -W.P.No.18778 of 2003 for a direction to the University to
                                               3

grant the said revised pay scales in terms of the decision of the University contained

in resolution dated 20.08.1997. It may be noticed that though the prayer was for

giving effect to the resolution dated 20.08.1997, the prayer in effect was for grant of

revised pay scales Rs. 550-900 w.e.f. 14.7.1979, Rs.700-1600 w.e.f. 1.4.1980, Rs.

2200-4000 w.e.f. 1.1.1986 and Rs.3000-5000 w.e.f. 14.7.1987, which had been earlier

rejected by Courts in two rounds of litigation. The High Court therefore dismissed

the writ petition on the ground that the suit filed by the appellant for the very same

relief and the appeal therefrom having been dismissed, the writ petition was not

maintainable. Dealing with the contention that the writ petition was with reference to

a different subsequent cause of action based on the resolution dated 20.08.1997, the

High Court observed that the plaint ought to have been amended to include a relief

with reference to the resolution dated 20.08.1997 and that not having been done, the

claim cannot be revived with reference to the resolution dated 20.08.1997. The

application for review filed by the appellant was also rejected on 26.06.1994. The

appellant has challenged the order of dismissal of the writ petition and review petition

in this appeal by special leave.
5.         As noticed above, there have been three rounds of litigation seeking the

same relief. The first is Writ Petition No.4262 of 1992 and SLP(C)No.16068 of 1992

wherein the prayer has been rejected. The second is in Civil Suit No. 194 of 1993 and

in Appeal No.96 of 2002/2003 which also ended in dismissal. The present third round

of litigation is for the very same relief. It is clear that the claim is liable to be rejected

having regard to Section 11 CPC and Order 2 Rule 2 CPC. Even on merits, we find
                                           4

that the appellant is not entitled to any relief. The resolution dated 20.08.1997 could

not be given effect as the requisite prior approval of the State Government was not

obtained and as a representative of the State Government was not present at the time

of such resolution. Therefore, Section 9F and 11A came in the way of giving effect to

the resolution. Even otherwise we find that the writ petition filed in the year 2003 to

enforce the resolution passed in 1997 nearly six years later, was liable to be rejected

even on the ground of delay and laches. Viewed from any angle the appeal deserves

to be rejected.
6.        Learned counsel for this appellant submitted that following the resolution

in the case of the appellant, relief has been given to someone else. Whether relief was

given to others or not, is totally irrelevant when considering the bar based on Section

11 and Order 2 Rule 2 CPC. Secondly, the relief that has been allegedly given in

other cases was also subject to the State Government's approval and not

unconditional. In this case the contention of the University is not that it has not

passed any resolution acceding to the appellant's request, but that it could not be

given effect for want of State Government's approval.
7.        There is no merit in this appeal and it is dismissed accordingly.

Dutt,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month. 1. In this appeal, the appellants, namely, the Union of India, the Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Steel, Mines and Coal (Department of Mines) and the Controller of Aluminium have challenged the propriety of the judgment of a learned Judge of this Court whereby the learned Judge made absolute the Rule Nisi issued on the application of Hindustan Aluminium Corporation Limited, hereinafter referred to as HINDALCO, and one of its share-holders, under Article 226 of the Constitution. In the writ application, the respondent HINDALCO challenged the propriety and legality of five orders of the Central Government, all dated Oct. 4. 1979 under the Aluminium Control Order, 1970 passed under Section 3 ef the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The legality and constitutional validity of the provisions of Clauses 4A and 4B of the Aluminium Control Order were also challenged in the writ application. 
 2. At all material times HINDALCO carried and still carries on the business of producing and/or manufacturing aluminium. It owns and operates an aluminium plant at Renukoot, in the district of Mirzapur, within the State of Uttar Pradesh. It produces and/or manufactures the following: (a) aluminium and alloy ingots, billets and wire bars, (b) aluminium wire rods known as 'properzi' rods, (c) aluminium rolled products in various shapes, (d) aluminium extrusions in various shapes and types of sections. 
 3. Besides HINDALCO, there are
three other companies which produce
and/or manufacture aluminium and its
products. These companies are Bharat
Aluminium Company Limited, which is
a Central Government company the
Madras Aluminium Company Ltd., and
Indian Aluminium Company Ltd., here
inafter referred to as BALCO, MALCO
and INDALCO respectively.
 4. The production of aluminium in India is of vital importance and it is essential for the growth, development and maintenance of the economy. The Central Government by virtue of its power under Clause (xi) of Section 2 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 declared aluminium to be an essential commodity by a notification dated June 29, 1957. 
 5. The demand for aluminium has been rising because of massive investment in generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, particularly in rural electrification programme. The demand for commercial grade aluminium has also been rising principally on account of compelling need for saving energy, aluminium being a very light metal with high heat conductivity. The production of aluminium in the country, however, has not been able to keep pace with the increase in demand although the present installed capacity is adequate to meet the current demand. The shortfall in production is due to inadequate availability of power to aluminium smelters. In the circumstances, the Central Government has been compelled to arrange import of aluminium since Sept 1977. Imports are now being made through the Minerals & Metals Trading Corporation (hereinafter called MMTC). 
 6. In order to combat inflation in the price of aluminium the Central Government by a notification dated May 20, 1970, issued under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act passed the Aluminium Control Order, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the Control Order) for the availability of aluminium and its products at fair prices and for regulating production, supply and distribution thereof. The Control Order was amended from time to time. 
 7. The consumption of power for production of one metric tonne of aluminium varies in different smelters of country under optimum conditions. One paise variation in the power tariff rate leads to a variation of about, Rs. 170/-per tonne (according to HINDALCO Rs. l80/- per tonne) in the cost of production of aluminium. Different State Electricity Boards charge different power tariff rates to the smelters catered to by them. The cost of production of aluminium per metric tonne, therefore, varies widely in different smelters. 
 8. In view of the rise in the cost of production, particularly the different

tariff rates, the cost of production of the four producers namely, HINDALCO, BALCO, MALCO and INDALCO was different The cost of production of BALCO and MALCO was much higher than that, of HINDALCO and INDALCO.  
  9. The Control Order as amended up to March 20, 1979 provides fixation of retention price and sale price of aluminium ingots produced by the said four producers. The retention price is fixed having regard to the estimated cost of production. The retention price is to he retained by the producer concerned, As the cost of production of HINDALCO and INDALCO were lower than that of BALCO and MALCO, the retention prices of HINDALCO and INDALCO were lower than the sale price, whereas the retention prices of BALCO and MALCO were higher than the sale price. If BALCO and MALCO were to sell aluminium, they would undoubtedly suffer loss and their industries will go on perpetually at a loss. In order to obviate this difficulty, the Control Order provides a method for fixation of the sale price. If the retention price of any producer is lower than the sale price, he has to pay the difference between the sale price and retention price to the Aluminium Regulation Account maintained by the Controller of Aluminium as provided in the Control Order. On the other hand, if thr., retention price of any producer is higher than the sale price, he would be paid the corresponding difference from the Aluminium Regulation Account. Under this method, the sale price is obtained by dividing the weighted average of the retention prices of aluminium by the total production of aluminium by the four producers. The mechanism of sale price as illustrated by the appellants in para 4.3 of their supplementary affidavit-in-opposition filed in the trial court is as follows: 
 10. On Oct. 4, 1979, the Central Government passed five orders as contained in the respective notification. By the said orders, the Central Government fixed the sale price and retention prices of indigenous aluminium sold as ingots, billets, wire bars and wire rods under Clause 4 (1) and the first proviso to Clause 4A of the Control Order, the retention prices of indigenous aluminium ingots under Clause 4A of the Control Order, the sale and retention prices of unwrought indigenous aluminium products by an aluminium producer and transferred by him to his auxiliary plant for further processing under the third proviso to Clause 4 (1) and Clause 4A of the Control Order and the sale price of imported aluminium under Clause 4 (2) of the Control Order. 
 11. On Oct. 5, 1979, the Central Government issued a Press Note. It has been, inter alia, stated in the Press Note that recently there has been an increase in the power tariff of some of the smelters, resulting in corresponding increase in the cost of production, and that considering all aspects of the matter, it has been decided by the Government to revise the price of indigenously produced metal to reflect the increase in the cost of production due to the revision in the rate of power tariff. Further, if, has been stated that the Government has also decided to pool the price of the domestic metal with the price of imported metal and to fix a uniform price. The prices of aluminium of different specifications inclusive of excise duty have also been stated in the said Press Note. It has also been stated that the imported aluminium will also be sold at the prices fixed in the Press Note. 
 12. By the impugned orders, the retention prices of HINDALCO have

been increased by Rs. 655/- per tonne. It is complained by HINDALCO that the said amount of Rs. 655/- per tonne is wholly inadequate having regard to the enormous increase in the cost of production that had taken place since October 1978. If is alleged that in making the impugned orders, the appellants have completely ignored the cost of production of aluminium, and that the said amount of Rs. 655/- does not even cover the increase in the cost of electrical power that has taken place since the prices of aluminium were last fixed in Oct. 1975. If has also been complained by HINDALCO that even the entire increase in the cost of power consumed by HINDALCO has not been taken into consideration by the Government in fixing the retention prices. Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Renusagar) is the wholly owned subsidiary of HINDALCO. Renusagar owns and operates a coal-fired thermal power plant which generates approximately 135 MW of power. The whole of the said power generated by Renusagar (excluding the power consumed by the auxiliary plant of Renusagar) is supplied to HINDALCO for the manufacture of aluminium. It is alleged that as a result of the increase in the prices of coal by the notification daled July 16, 1979, the cost of generation of power of Renusagar has increased by about 2.25 paise per unit. Consequently the cost of production of aluminium by HINDALCO has also increased. It is alleged that in fixing the retention prices, the Government had not taken into consideration and included in the retention prices, the cost which HINDALCO has to bear on account of generation of power by Renusagar which is fully consumed by HINDALCO in the production and manufacture of aluminium. 
 13. On Jan. 15, 1970, the Central Government set up a body known as the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices (hereinafter referred to as BICP) for the purpose of giving advice to the Central Government on industrial costs and prices. In September, 1977, the BICP and the Additional Secretary fo the Government of India, Ministry of Steel, Mines and Coal (Department of Mines) recommended that since the last fixation of prices in October 1978, the increase in the cost of production of aluminium was more than Rs. 900/- per tonne on

account of increase in the cost of raw materials other than power, and that the sale prices and retention prices of aluminium should be increased accordingly. The BICP and the said Additional Secretary also recommended further increase in the selling and retention prices of aluminium on, account of power. It is complained by HINDALCO that in spite of the aforesaid recommendations by the BICP and the said Additional Secretary the Central Government; in making the impugned orders, has arbitrarily and without any basis whatsoever completely ignored the increase in the cost of raw materials other than power which are important items in the cost of production of aluminium. 
 14. It is alleged that the sale and retention prices of HINDALCO fixed by the impugned orders do not cover even direct costs incurred for the manufacture of aluminium by HINDALCO. HINDALCO is now suffering a cash loss of approximately Rs. 1315/- per tonne of aluminium manufactured and sold by HINDALCO apart from the loss caused by the non-recovery of overhead, depreciation and return and the like. On a total production and sale of 110 tonnes of aluminium per day HINDALCO is now suffering a cash loss of approximately Rs. 1.45 lakhs per tonne. The said loss is wholly beyond the capacity of HINDALCO to bear. 
 15. It is thus apparent that HINDALCO feels aggrieved by the fixation of the retention prices of aluminium. According to HINDALCO, in fixing the retention prices of aluminium, the Central Government has not taken into account the increase in the cost of production since the fixation of retention prices in Oct. 1978. It has not also taken into consideration the increase in the cost of power which is supplied to it by Renusagar, a subsidiary of HINDALCO. 
 16. On Oct. 5, 1979, that is, on the day following, the impugned orders were passed, HINDALCO preferred an appeal against the impugned orders to the Central Government under Clause 11 of the Control Order. During the pendency of the said appeal, on Oct. 24, 1979, HINDALCO filed a writ petition before a learned single Judge of this Court whereupon the Rule Nisi out of which this appeal arises was issued.  
 17. At the hearing of the Rule Nisi, it was contended inter alia on behalf of HINDALCO as follows: (1) Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control Order were ultra vires Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. (2) The sale and renten-tion prices of aluminium were not fixed in accordance with Clauses 4 and 4A of the Control Order and. as such, the impugned orders were illegal and should be quashed. (3) Increases in the cost of production not having been taken into account in fixing the retention prices for HINDALCO the impugned orders were illegal and liable to be set aside. (4) The amount of money being the difference between the sale price and retention price which HINDALCO was required to pay to the Aluminium Regulation Account was tantamount to imposition of tax without any legislative sanction therefor and not authorised by Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. Accordingly, such imposition of tax was void and HINDALCO could not be asked to pay the differences between the sale price and retention price to the Aluminium Regulation Account. (5) The impugned orders were void under Article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch as HINDALCO was discriminated vis-a-vis BALCO without any reasonable justification therefor. (6) In fixing the sale and retention prices of aluminium by the impugned orders, the Central Government violated the rules Of natural justice in not giving HINDALCO a proper and reasonable Opportunity of being heard and, as such, the impugned orders were void. 
 18. On the other hand, the appellants and the MMTC sought to refute the above contentions of HINDALCO. The Central Government took preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the writ petition by HINDALCO, such objections were supported by MMTC. It was contended on behalf of the Central Government that this Court had no jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition inasmuch as no part of the cause of action arose within the territorial limits of this Court over which it exercises jurisdiction. Further, HINDALCO having availed itself of an alternative remedy by preferring an appeal to the Central Government under Clause 11 of the Control Order, the writ petition was not maintainable. 
 19. The learned Judge, after considering the facts and circumstances of

the case and the submissions made on behalf of the parties, overruled the said preliminary objections raised on behalf of the Central Government and supported by MMTC. It was held by the learned Judge that a part of the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court and, as such, this Court had jurisdiction to entertain and dispose of the writ petition. So far as the objection to the maintainability of the writ petition on the ground of an alternative remedy is concerned, it was observed by the learned Judge that although Clause 11 of the Control Order provided for an appeal, no rules or procedure had been laid down for hearing or disposal of such appeals and no particular Tribunal or Authority had been expressly empowered to hear such appeals. During the pendency of the proceeding, the Government had nominated two officers to hear the appeal which seemed to the learned Judge to be an ad hoc arrangement. Further, HINDALCO had challenged the vires of Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control Order, and the same could not be decided by the appellate authority. In that view of the matter, the learned Judge held that, the alternative remedy was not a bar to the maintainability of the writ petition. 
 20. As regards the contention of HINDALCO, the learned Judge overruled all of them except one which will be stated presently. The learned Judge came to the finding that since 1978 there had been a steady increase in the prices of raw materials required for the production of aluminium, and that in fixing the prices under the impugned orders, the Government had taken into account only the rise in the rate of electricity charges and nothing more. It was observed by the learned Judge that by fixing the retention price below the cost of production, a producer might be compelled to sell its products at a loss till such price was re-fixed. As, according to the learned Judge, the Central Government had not. taken into consideration the increases in the costs of production, it acted illegally in violation of the provisions of Clauses 4 and 4A of the Control Order. Upon the said fiindings, the learned Judge allowed the writ application in part directing the Central Government. to re-consider the retention and sale prices fixed in respect of the products of 'HINDALCO, in the light of the observation made by

him in his judgment, and that till the same was done, the learned Judge directed the appellants not to give effect to the prices of aluminium fixed by the Central Government by the impugned orders. 
 21. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned Judge, the present appeal has been filed by the Union of India and others. HINDALCO has also filed a cross-objection to the findings of the learned Judge overruling its other contentions as indicated above. 
 22. At the very outset, Mr. Noni Coomer Chakraborti, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has urged the said two preliminary objections to the maintainability of the writ petition filed by HINDALCO. The first objection relates to. the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain and hear the writ petition and the second one to the bar of the writ petition on the ground of the alternative remedy of an appeal as provided for in Clause 11 of the Control Order. So far as the first, objection is concerned, it has been submitted by the learned Counsel that the impugned orders were all passed by the Central Government in New Delhi. The aluminium plant of HINDALCO is situate at Renukut, in the District of Mirzapur, within the State of Uttar Pradesh, outside the jurisdiction of this Court. It is, accordingly, submitted that no part of cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of this Court and, as such, this Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition. 
 23. On the other hand, it is contended by Mr. Sidhartha Shankar Ray, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of HINDALCO that although its factory is situate at Renukoot, the impugned orders have adversely affected the business carried on by HINDALCO in Calcutta within the jurisdiction of this Court. It is pointed out by him that HINDALCO has its principal office wherefrom it carries on its business at Birla Building in Calcutta, Substantial quantity of goods manufactured by HINDALCO are sold in West Bengal and in particular at Calcutta and the said sales are dealt with, inter alia, by the said office of HINDALCO at Calcutta. HINDALCO holds large stocks of aluminium manufactured by it in or around Calcutta through different Consigning Agents. The sub-
stantial amount of sale proceeds out of which HINDALCO is compelled to pay into the Aluminium Regulation Account by virtue of the impugned orders was received in Calcutta. It is submitted thai in view of the impugned orders, HINDALCO has been suffering lass in Calcutta also. Accordingly, it is submitted that as the impugned orders have affected the business of HINDALCO in Calcutta, a part of the cause of action arose in Calcutta and this Court had jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition. 
 24. Under Article 226(2) of the Constitution, the High Court may exercise its power conferred by Clause (1) of Article 226 to issue, directions, orders or writs if the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises within the territory over which it exercises jurisdiction. It is now well settled that 'cause of action' means every fact which the plaintiff should prove, if traversed, in order to succeed in the suit. HINDALCO has come with a case that in view of the impugned orders, it. has been suffering loss in its business in the sale of aluminium and its products produced and manufactured by it in Calcutta where its principal office is situate. If there had been no allegation of incurring of any loss as a result of the impugned orders, we are afraid, there would not have given rise to any cause of action either wholly or in part, in Calcutta. Normally no person institutes any suit or proceeding unless his right is jeopardized or prejudiced in consequence of any action of a private individual or of the Government. In the writ petition, there has been a categorical averment of the suffering of loss by HINDALCO by the sale of aluminium and aluminium products in Calcutta. We are now not concerned with the truth or otherwise of the allegation as the question of jurisdiction is to be determined on the basis of the allegations made in the writ petition. If there was no such allegation of any loss suffered by HINDALCO in Calcutta, the High Court would not, entertain the writ petition, however, illegal the impugned orders may be. A writ petition is not entertained unless the petitioner comes with a case that he has been prejudiced by any action of the Government or a statutory body or authority. So, in our opinion, the writ petition, prima facie, discloses that a

part of cause-of-action  arose in  Calcutta within   the  jurisdiction  of this  Court. 
 25.    Mr.     Chakrataorti     has,     however, placed much reliance upon  a decision of a learned   single   Judge    of    this     Court (Sisir Kumar Mukherjea J.) in Darshanlal Anand Prakash v.   Collector of   Customs   &   Central   Excise,   Shillong,      1974 Cal  LJ 27.    In that case,  the petitioners challenged   the  notifications   under     item 3 (1)   of the First   Schedule  to the  Central Excises  and  Salt Act.  1944.    By the said   notifications,   the   Central      Government classified the tea gardens into five zones   for the   purpose of  levying   excise duty   at  varying  rates  on  tea    produced at  the gardens according to the zones to which   they    belonged.      The      challenge of  the   petitioners,   therefore,   related    to the levy of duties    of    excise    on    the manufacture and production of tea.    The, manufacture     and     production     of     tea by  the petitioners    took    place    in    the State   of  Assam.       The   levy   and   collection  of  duties of excise  also took   place in the State of Assam.    It was, however, contended on  behalf   of   the     petitioners that by reason of   the    said    levy    the financial position  of the   petitioners   was adversely     affected     and     such     adverse effect was felt by them in Calcutta.   The question  was  whether    a    part    of    the cause--of-action   had   arisen   in   Calcutta. In  support   of    the     contention    that    a part   of    the    cause-of-action     arose    in Calcutta,   it  was    contended    on     behalf of the petitioners that  as  they    had    to deposit money in the Reserve  Bank    of India  at  its  Calcutta  office for the payment  of excise duty, it should be   held that a part  of the    cause-of-action    had arisen in  Calcutta  and,  accordingly,   this Court   had   jurisdiction   to   entertain     the writ   petition.     It was    held    that     such deposit was not payment of excise  duty so long as it was not    appropriated    by the  Collector of  Customs   and  such    appropriation  took place at Assam by   the Collector of     Customs by     debiting the current   account maintained  by the     assessee in Assam.    Accordingly,   the   said contention of    the    petitioners    was not accepted by the     learned    Judge.      The learned Judge also overruled    the    contention    of    the    petitioners     that    the effect of the impugned  notifications   was felt by the petitioners in their places of business  including Calcutta.    There was, however, no averment and also no finding in that case that the petitioner    had suffered loss in their business in Calcutta

as a result of the impugned notifications. In our opinion, it has been rightly observed by the learned Judge that the effect felt at a place of business of the petitioners by reason of imposition of duty levied on the petitioners' tea, is far too remote and incidental to constitute a part of the cause-of-action, Further, there is a clear distinction between the effect being felt at a place of business and suffering of loss in the business by reason of an impugned order of the Government. We do not, therefore, think that Darshanlal's case is of any help to the appellants. Nor do we think that the decision of the Supreme Court in the Advocate-General, State of Bihar v. Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries,  supports the contention of the appellants inasmuch as the facts of that case are completely different from those of the instant case before us. In the circumstances, we agree with the learned trial Judge that a part of the cause-of-action arose in Calcutta and this Court had jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition.
 26. Now we come to the next preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition. It is contended that as HINDALCO has availed itself of a remedy by way of an appeal under Clause 11 of the Control Order, the writ petition was not maintainable, Clause 11 provides that any producer, manufacturer or dealer or importing agent or any other person aggrieved by any order or direction issued under this order, may, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the copy of such order or direction, prefer an appeal to the Central Government and thereupon the Central Government may confirm, reverse or modify such order or direction. In this connection, it may be noticed that the appeal was filed by HINDALCO on Oct. 3, 1979 that is to say, on the next day of the passing of the impugned orders, all dated October 4, 1979. On Oct. 24, 1979, the Rule Nisi out of which this appeal arises was issued and an ad interim order was made by the learned Judge. On November 29, 1979, that is to say, during the pendency of the Rule Nisi, the Central Government constituted a bench consisting of two Joint Secretaries
for hearing the appeal preferred by HINDALCO under Clause 11 of the Control Order. 
 27. It is now well settled that where there is an adequate and efficacious alternative remedy, the High Court will not normally entertain a writ petition. This principle of law has come into existence by virtue of judicial decisions imposing self restriction on the exercise of power under Article 226 of the Constitution where there is an adequate and efficacious alternative remedy. The question of an alternative remedy being a bar is, however, a question of discretion and not of jurisdiction. Clause 11 of the Control Order provides for an alternative remedy by way of an appeal. The appeal has to be preferred to the Central Government and it is the Central Government that will dispose of the appeal. The impugned orders have all been passed by the Central Government and, although Clause 11 provides an appeal to the Central Government in our opinion, it serves no purpose. The authority which has passed an order cannot constitute itself the appellate authority against such an order. If there had been a provision for review, it would be understandable, but it is not comprehensible how an appeal would lie to the Central Government when the Central Government itself has passed the imupgned orders. In the circumstances, we do not think that the provision for appeal under Clause 11 of the Control Order is an alternative remedy to HINDALCO. The two Joint Secretaries who have been appointed by the Central Government to hear the appeal of HINDALCO are subordinate officers of the Central Government and, we are afraid, such officers would not be able to call in question the impugned orders of the Central Government. In any event, there will always be an apprehension in the mind of the appellant that no justice will be done to it in the appeal. It is true that HINDALCO has preferred an appeal before the writ petition was filed in this Court, but so far as this Court is concerned, before refusing to entertain the writ petition, it should be satisfied that the remedy which has been resorted to by HINDALCO is an alternative remedy in the true sense of the term and the relief which is sought for under Article 226 of the Constitution may be available to it in the appeal. But, as has been stated already, no appeal can lie to the Central Government against the impugned orders passed by the Central Government, the provision of Clause 11 of the Control Order does not afford an alternative remedy to HINDALCO. Moreover, in the writ petition, HINDALCO has challenged the validity of Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control Order. The appellate authority under Clause 11 will not be entitled to decide the question whether Clauses 4A and 4B are ultra vires Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act or not. For all this, we hold that the writ petition is quite maintainable and the provision under Clause 11 is not an alternative remedy and is, therefore, no bar to the maintainability of the writ petition. 
 28. Before we consider the contentions of the parties On the merits Of the case ,we may discuss a few other relevant facts. The Control Order or the price control applies only to 50% of the total production by each producer in the form of electrical grade metal. The price-controlled metal was required to he delivered by the producers to the State Electricity Boards, Government Department or to any other person as directed by the Central Government. This metal is known as 'levy aluminium'. The remaining metal, that is, commercial grade was left free from price control and the producers were expected to realise the cost elements of financing charges, depreciation and profits by the sale thereof. The dual pricing policy resulted a sharp increase in the price of non-levy aluminium affecting particularly, the weaker sections of the community who are large number of users of aluminium utensils. In view of this and other considerations, the Government decided to abolish the dual pricing system for aluminium and in its place introduced a uniform price for primary metal, that is, electrical conductor grade and commercial grade ingots and wire rods, wire bars/billets made from electrical conductor grade metal. The revised prices, on a uniform basis, were introduced on Oct. 18, 1978: The retention price fixed for each aluminium producer under this policy covered the full cost of production. By virtue of the notification No. S. O. 357 (E) dated July 15, 1975 read with the notification being S. O. 600 (E) dated Oct. 16, 1975. the Government would be entitled to direct each producer to supply aluminium to the extent of 50% of his monthly production in the form of aluminium ingets, wire

bars or billets or wire rods to such of the consumers as may be specified by the Controller or such other officer authorised by the Central Government in this behalf, at such price as may be fixed by the Central Government, from time to time, under the Control Order. It is now necessary to refer to Clauses 3, 4, 4A and Sub-clauses (1) to (4) of Clause 4B of the Control Order, which are as follows: 
 Provided that, where the Central Government may require any producer to supply, under Clause 4C indigenous aluminium of such specifications and in such quantities to such persons specified in that Clause, the Central Government or the Controller may, if it is considered necessary so to do, fix in respect of such indigenous aluminium, separate sale prices: 
 4A. Fixation of retention price of indigenous aluminium : 
 Provided that where the retention prie of unwrought indigenous aluminium produced and transferred by a producer to his auxiliary plant for further processing and sale as indigenous aluminium of different specifications, is higher than the sale price, such producer shall be paid from the money standing to the credit of Aluminium Regulation Account, an amount equivalent to the product of the difference between the retention price and sale price in respect of each tonne of unwrought indigenous aluminium and the number of tonnes of indigenous aluminium sold by such producer and for which no sale price has been fixed.""  
 29. The Control Order has been passed under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. The dominant object of Section 3 of the Act is maintenance of or increase in supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices. In order to fulfil that object, Section 3 authorises the Central Government to pass orders which may provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution of an essential commodity and trade and commerce therein. Clause (c) of Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act lays down that such an order may provide for controlling the price at. which any essential commodity may be bought or sold. Clause (f) of Sub-section (2) also provides for requiring any person holding in stock, or engaged in the production, or in the business of buying or selling of any essential commodity to sell the whole or a specified part of the quantity held in stock or produced or received by him, or in the case of any such commodity which is likely to be produced or received by him, to sell the whole or a specified part of such commodity when produced or received by him to the Central Government or a State Government, or to an officer or agent of such Government, or to a Corporation owned or controlled by such Government or to such person or class of persons and in such circumstances as may be specified in the order. 
 30. The grievance of HINDALCO is that the retention prices for aluminium have not been fixed in accordance with the Clause 4A of the Control Order. its case is that although Clause 4A

provides for the fixation of the retention price of indigenous aluminium having regard to all relevant factors, including the estimated cost of production of indigenous aluminium, the Government has not at all taken into consideration the increase in the prices of essential commodities, such as steel, paper, cement, coal and petroleum products which the Government was bound to take into account, The Government has not also taken into consideration the increase in the power tariff rate fully and it has also altogether ignored the cost of power supply to HTNDALCO by Renusagar, a 100% subsidiary of HINDALCO. It has been urged by Mr. Ray, learned Counsel for HINDALCO that in view of the expression ""having regard"" to Clause 4A, the Government should not only take into consideration the estimated cost off production but also ensure the cost of production in the retention price that may be fixed by the Government. It is submitted that far from reflecting the increases in the prices of inputs required for production and manufacture of aluminium, the Government has not at all taken into consideration such increase in the fixation of retention prices. Before considering whether the Government is bound to reflect in the retention price of indigenous aluminium the estimated cost of production or the increase in the prices of various items of inputs, we may first of all consider whether the Government has taken into consideration such increases in the cost of production. 
 31. It appears that during the year 1978 till October, 1978, there was little or no increase in the purchase cost of main raw materials and inputs required for the production of aluminium. The Central Government had taken into account the prices of inputs on May 1, 1978 and the power tariff rate as revised subsequently in July 1978, and prices fixed in October 1978 reflected the entire cost of production. In para. 22 (i) of the affidavit in opposition of the appellants affirmed by one Hirak Ghosh, the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Steel, Mines and Coal (Department of Mines) and Controller of Aluminium, it has been categorically averred that before issuing the impugned notifications the Government examined the increase in the cost of production of HINDALCO and also of other

aluminium producers, and that the respective retention prices of the producers, namely, HINDALCO, INDALCO, BALCO and MALCO reflected the increase in the power rates only. A supplementary affidavit-in-opposition affirmed by the said Hirak Ghosh was filed by the appellants with the leave of the learned trial Judge. In para. 11 of the supplementary affidavit-in-opposition, it has also been categorically staled, inter alia, that the Government increased the price of aluminium taking note of the increase in the cost of production due to the increase in the prices of certain essential commodities such as steel, paper, cement, power, coal and petroleum products. Such increase in the prices of each essential commodity was considered by the Government on its own merits. 
 32. According to HINDALCO, the Government has not even taken into consideration such increases in the costs of production, but that has been denied by the appellants and, as noticed above, it is the positive case of the appellants that such increases have been taken into consideration before fixing the retention prices of indigenous aluminium, Our attention has been drawn by Mr. Ray to the fact that para. 11 of the supplementary affidavit-in-opposition has not been properly affirmed. The said paragraph has been affirmed as true to the information of the deponent without disclosing from which source he derived such information. It must be said that para 11 has not been properly affirmed, but even if we leave out of consideration para 11, the other averments in the affidavit-in-opposition pointed out above show that, the Government has taken into consideration the increase in the cost of production. 
 33. The learned Counsel for HINDALCO submits that the appellants have not denied the averment in para 46 (e) of the writ petition. In that para, if, has been stated, inter alia, that the Central Government did not have regard to or proper regard to the estimated cost of production and other material factors so far as HINDALCO was concerned, Para 46 (e) has been dealt with by the appellants in para 34 (ii) of the affidavit-in-opposition in which it has been submitted inter alia that in the light of the provision of Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, the cost of pro-duction itself is of no relevance. It is

true that in Clause (ii) of Para 34, there has been no denial of the averments made in para 46 (e) of the petition. Para 34, however, starts with the following: ""That the contentions made by the petitioners in para 46 of the petition are not admitted. I say that proper submissions will be made thereon, on behalf of the respondent at the time of hearing."" The learned Additional Soliciter General has placed reliance upon the starting words of para 34 and submits that the allegations made in paragraph 46 including para 46 (e) of the petition have not been admitted which means a denial of the same. Much submissions have been made on the scope and extent of the word ""not admitted"". There can be no doubt that a fact stated to be not admitted is a denial of that fact. It would have been better for the appellants to specifically deny the allegations made in para 46 (e) of the petition. We do not, however, think that the absence of any specific denial is fatal to the appellants, for in considering whether an allegation, has been denied or not, the Court should not be too technical in the matter. Where, as in the instant case, allegations contained in the particular paragraph have not been specifically denied, before coming to any finding that such, allegations have been admitted by non-traverse, it will be the duty of the Court to take into consideration other averments in the affidavit and then to decide whether the allegations have been denied or not. Assertion of a fact which is contrary to another fact, is a denial of that another fact, even though the same is not specifically denied. In the instant case, HINDALCO has repeated the allegations that there has been no consideration of the increase in the cost of production by the Central Government. On the other hand, in the affidavit-in-opposition the appellants have in many places specifically averred that there has been such consideration by the Central Government. So, in our opinion, even though para 46 (e) of the petition has not been specifically denied by the appellants, it is difficult to uphold the contentions of HINDALCO that the appellants have, by non-traverse of that paragraph, admitted non-consideration by the Central Government of the increase in the cost of production. There is no reason why we should not believe the ease of the ap-
pellants as pleaded in their affidavit-in-opposition that the Government had taken into consideration the increase in the cost of production. Accordingly, we do not accept the contention of HINDALCO that the Government, had not considered at all the increases in the cost of production. 
 34. The next question that requires consideration is whether in view of the expression ""having regard to"" the Government was under a duty to ensure the producers of aluminium including HINDALCO the cost of production including increases in such cost in the retention prices. In this connection, we may refer to a decision of the Privy Council in Ishak v. Thowfeek, (1968) 1 WLR 1718, where Lord Pearson observed as follows: 
 The above observation of Lord Pearson which has been relied on by Mr. Ray does not support his contention that in view of the expression ""having regard to"" in Clause 4A of the Control Order, the Government is enjoined to ensure or reflect in the retention price the increases in the cost of production. A Statutory requirement to ""have regard"" to any existing terms or circumstances does not necessarily mean a duty to comply with them (Stroude' Judicial Dictionary Fourth Edn, Vol. 2, Page 1214). That statements has been made with reference to the decision of the Privy Council in Ishak v. Thowfeek (supra). Thus by the said observation of Lord Pearson it has not been laid down that the expression ""have regard to"" means a duty. The expression, in our opinion, means that all relevant factors should be taken into account and tonsidered before the Government fixes the retention price. In Ryots of Gara-bandha v. Zamindar of Parlakimedi, AIR 1943 PC 164, the Privy Council observed that the expression ""have regard to"" only obliged the Government to consider all relevant materials to which it must have regard. The Supreme

Court had occasion to consider the   expression ""having regard    to""    in    Saraswati      Industrial      Syndicate      Ltd.    v. Union of India  . Under     Clause     7     (2)     of     the    Sugar Control Order passed under   Section    3 of the   Essential    Commodities   Act,   the Government is  required to fix the price ""having regard to the estimated cost   of production of sugar on the basis of the relevant schedule"". In interpreting    the term ""having regard to""    Beg J.    (as he then was) relied on    the    interpretation given to the   expression    by   the   Privy Council    in    Ryots  of    Garabandhe   v. Zamindar of    Parlakimedy.    The   appellants  before   the    Supreme    Court    also conceded that what the    Privy    Council had said was the effect of the language of Clause 7 (2) of    the    Sugar    Control Order.    We are    unable to    accept    the contention    of   the   learned  Counsel    for HINDALCO that the interpolation given to the term  ""having  regard  to""   by    the Supreme Court was on the basis of   the concession made by the appellants.    Had it been so, the    Supreme    Court    would not have referred to the said observation of the Privy Council.    In our    opinion, the  Supreme Court accepted   the    interpretation   given   by   the    Privy    Council which was  also conceded to by the    appellants. The importance of the decision of   the  Supreme    Court    in    Saraswati's case is  that the  Supreme Court had    to interpret the similar expression,   namely, ""having regard to the estimated cost   of production,  occurring  in  Clause 7   (2)  of the Sugar Control Order as in Clause 4A of the Control Order with which we are concerned,   both the orders   having   been passed  under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act.
 35. In the later decision of the Supreme Court in State of Karnataka v. Ranganatha Reddy,  the Supreme Court considered the contents and purports of the expressions ""having regard to"" and ""shall have regard to"" and. after referring to some English decisions and the decision in Saraswati's case (supra), took the same view as expressed by Beg J. in Saraswati's case (supra). The expression ""having regard to"" as interpreted by the Privy Council and the. Supreme Court does not support the contention of HINDALCO that such expression enjoins the Government to ensure or reflect the estimated cost of production in the retention, price, What

it enjoins is, therefore, that the Government shall have regard to all the relevant factors relating to the cost of production of indigenous aluminium. There can be no doubt that consideration does not mean to give a cursory glance by the Government on the relevant materials, but it requires giving due weight to such materials. Thereafter, it would be the concern of the Government whether it would include all factors in the cost of production in the retention price or not and, in this respect, the decision of the Government would be final and conclusive unless it demonstrably leads to manifest injustice and hardship.
 In an earlier decision in Union of India v. Kamalabai,  relied upon by Mr. Ray for HINDALCO. the Supreme Court had to consider the scope and extent of Section 8(1)(e) of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952. Clause (e) relates to the making of an award by the Arbitrator determining the amount of compensation payable for the requisitioning or the acquisition of any property. It provides inter alia that in making an award, the Arbitrator shall have regard to the circumstances of each case and the provisions of Sub-sections (2) and (3) so far as they are applicable. Sub-sections (2) and (3) enjoin what the amount of compensation payable for the requisitioning or the acquisition of any property shall consist of. It has been observed by G. K. Mitter J. who delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court that the expression ""have regard to'' in Sub-clause (e) of Sub-section (1) of Section 8 does not, give the Arbitrator any freedom of considering the two modes laid down in Sub-section (3) and accepting the one which he thinks fair. It is clear that the expression ""having regard to"" has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as above in the context of Section 8(1)(e) and subsections (2) and (3) thereof. After the acquisition of any property, the Government is to pay compensation to the owner of the property, such compensation should be the just equivalent of the market price. Indeed, Sub-section (3) of Section 8 which has been couched in a mandatory language provides as to what should be the amount of compensation payable for acquisition of any

property. In that context, it has been held by the Supreme Court that the expression ""having regard to"" in Clause (e) of Section 8(1) does not confer on the Arbitrator any discretion not to include in the amount of compensation, any of the amounts as mentioned in Cls. (a) and (b) of Sub-section (3). If the Arbitrator had such a discretion, in that case, the compensation that would be awarded might not be the just equivalent of the market price. In the circumstances, we do not think that the said interpretation of the term ""having regard to"" as made by the Supreme Court in Kamala-bai's case (supra) in the context of the facts of that case will have any application to the instant case. 
 36. In this connection, we shall con
sider a few other decisions of the Sup
reme Court which have been relied on
by the learned Counsel for HINDALCO.
In Panipat Co-Operative Sugar Mills
v. Union of India,  and
in Anakapalle Co-Op. Agrl. & In
dustrial Society Ltd. v. Union of India,
, the Supreme Court
had to consider Section 3(3C) of the
Essential Commodities Act. Section 3(3C) reads as follows:
 Explanation.-- For the purpose of this sub-section, ""producer"" means a person carrying on the business of manufacturing sugar."" 
 In these two decisions, the Supreme Court has not interpreted or considered the expression ""having regard to"" occurring in Section 3(3C) of the Essential Commodities Act, but held that the fair price has to fee determined in respect of the entire products ensuring to the industry a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar. One of the factors to which the Government shall have regard to in determining the price of sugar is the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar. It is contended by Mr. Ray that in holding that the fair price has to be determined in respect of the entire production ensuring to the in industry a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar, the Supreme Court had in its mind the expression ""having regard to"" in Section 3(3C) and the scope and extent thereof. In support of the said contention, much reliance has been placed by Mr. Ray on a later decision of the Supreme Court in Prag Ice & Oil Mills v. Union of India, AIR 1979 SC 1296. That was a case on the Mustard Oil (Price Contral) Order, 1977 issued under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. In that case, one of the contentions of petitioners was that fixation of a price without en-suring a reasonable return to the pro-ducers or dealers was unconstitutional In support of that contention, the decision of the Supreme Court in Panipat's case (supra) and in Anakapalle's case (supra) were relied upon. In repelling the said contention, the Supreme Court observed as follows (at p. 1316).
 37. Relying upon the said observation of the Supreme Court it has been strenuously urged by Mr. Ray that in view of the expression ""having regard to"" in Section 3(3C) of the Essential Commodities Act, the Supreme Court was of the view that it was statutorily obligatory to ensure to the industry a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar. The same expression being in Clauae 4A of the Control Order, Mr. Ray submits, it should be held that it is statutorily oblgatory on the part of the Central Government to ensure to the aluminium industry the estimated cost of pvoduction or the increases in the cost of production in the retention price of indigenous aluminium. Counsel submits that in Prag Ice & Oil Mills' case, the Supreme Court has, in effect construed the expression ""having regard to"" as denoting an obligation on the part of the Government.
 38. Attractive though the contention is, we regret, we are unable to accept the same. It will be incorrect to say that in Prag Ice & Oil Mills' case (AIR 1976 SC 1296), the Supereme Court considered or interpreted the expression ""having regard to"" accurring in. Sec. 3(3C) of the Essential Commodities Act. It is true that in Panipat's case and in Ankapalle's case , it has been observed that Section 3(3C) ensures a reasonablev return to the pre-ducers or manufacturers of sugar on the capital employed by them but such ob-servation has been, made not on the interpretation of the term ""having regazd to"", but for some other reasons which will be stated presently.
 39. In Panipal's case (AIR 1973 SC 507) the Supreme COURT has noticed that Sub-section (8C) of Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act was incorporated into the Act b an amendment

thereof, Further, the Tariff Commission in 1956 and the Sugar Enquiry Commission in 1965 had worked out the zonal cost schedules on the basis of averaged recovery and duration, the minimum and not the actual price of cane, the averaged conversion costs and recommended a reasonable return on the capital employed by the industry in the business of manufacturing sugar. This
experience was before the legislature at the time when Sub-section (3C) was inserted in the Act. The legislature therefore, incorporated the same formula in the new sub-section as the basis for working out the price. The purpose behind enacting the new sub-section was three-fold, namely, to provide an incentive, to increase production of sugar, encourage expansion of the industry to devise a means toy which the cane producer could get a share in the profits
of the industry through prices for his cane higher than the minimum price fixed and secure to the consumer distribution of at least a reasonable quantity of sugar at a fair price. It has been observed by the Supreme Court that there can be
no doubt that these were the objectives for which the sub-section was passed. It is thus apparent that in the background of the facts stated above, the Supreme Court in the cases of Panipat and Anakapaile held that, a reasonable return should be ensured to the sugar industry on the capital employed. Further, in that background, Sub-section (3C) was interpreted by the Supreme Court as making it obligatory for the Government to secure a reasonable return on the capital employed in fixing the price of sugar and that has also been noticed fey the Supreme Court in its later decision in Prag Ice & Oil Mills' case. We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention of the learned Counsel for HINDALCO that in view of the said observation of the Supreme Court in Prag Ice & Oil Mill's case it should be held that under Clause 4A of the Control Order, it is statutorily obligatory for the Government to ensure or reflect in the retention price, the estimated cost of production or the increases in the prices of inputs.
 40. It is said on behalf of HINDALCO that, if the Government is not bound to include in the retention price all the increases in the cost of production, reasonable return on the capital employed apart, the producer will suffer

loss, it is urged that the Government not having reflected in the retention price the increases in the prices of various inputs of production for which the Government is responsible and the
whole of increase in the power tariff rate, HINDALCO has suffered loss since the revision of retention and sale prices m terms of the impugned orders. Indeed. from the balance sheet of HINDALCO for the year 1980 an endeavour has been made before us by the learned Counsel for HINDALCO to show that in that year HINDALCO has suffered a loss of about Rs. 21 lakhs in regard to production of aluminium. The appellants and MMTC, however, do not admit that HINDALCO has suffered any loss whatsoever; on the contrary, it is their case that HINDALCO has made a profit of 1,98,47,197/- after deducting from
its income a sum of RS. 14,30,44,230/-which has been set apart as the amount payable to the Aluminium Regulation Account. It is, however submitted on behalf of HINDALCO that in calculat-its income from production of aluminium, its income from sources other than from aluminium amounting to Rupees 1,40,23,342/- should be excluded and upon such exclusion, the balance sheet shows that HINDALCO has suffer-
ed a loss of Rs. 20,76,145/-. Much submissions have been made on behalf of the parties as to whether HINDALCO has suffered a loss or has gained a profit or not The question of profit or loss was not raised before the learned trial Judge, the balance sheet was not produced and no affidavit in support of the respective cases of the parties relating to profits and loss of HINDALCO was filed. At this stage, we do not propose to embark on the question whether HINDALCO has suffered a loss or has gained a profit from its aluminium business in 1980. We shall, however proceed on the assumption that HINDALCO has suffered a less of Rupees 20,00,000/- and odd in 1980 as a result of the implementation of the impugned orders or the revision of the retention and sale prices of aluminium. 
 41. A question will naturally arise whether the Government will be justified in fixing the retention price of aluminium in such a way as would entail a loss to the industry. Mr. Ray has placed reliance upon the observation of Ray C. J. in Meenakshee Mill's case  (supra) on Cotten

Textile (Control) Order; 1948 that the fair price must be fair not only from the point of view of the consumer but also from the point of view of the producer, and that any restriction in excess of what would be necessary in the interest of general public or to remedy the evil. has to be very carefully considered so that the producer does not perish and the consumer is not crippled, At the same time, it has also been ob-
served that the aspect of ensuring availability of the essential commodities to the consumer equitably and at fair price is the most important consideration. The dominant object, of Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act as stated already, is maintenance and increase in supplies, equitably distribution and availability at fair price of the essential commodity and, with that object in view the Government has to take
measures for regulating the production or manufacture of any essential commodity and for controlling the price at which such commodity may be bought or sold. These mesures are taken obviously in the interest of the consumers which is of paramount consideration. The interest of producer or manufacturers of an essential commodity is no doubt a factor to be taken into consideration, but surely it is of much lesser importance and must yield to the interest of the general public who are the consumers. This does not mean that the Government will not look to the interest of the industry, and it is the
duty   of the Government to strike a balance between the need or the demand for the essential commodity concerned   and the interest of the industry. but in no case the interest of the industry should be given preference and predominant consideration surrendering public benefit. If in serving the interest of the public the industry has to suffer a loss for a temporary period, such loss cannot, be considered a relevant factor in setting at naught the governmental action in faxing the price of an essential commodity. Care should also be taken by the Government to see that the loss is not a perpetual one or a huge loss which may result in the closure of the industry but because the industry has suffered a loss for the time being that will be no ground for setting aside the governmental policy relating to the fixation of the_price of an essential

commodity. The Price Control Order is to achieve the objectives of Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, namely, for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices. The Court will consider whether such objectives have been achieved by the Price Control Order, and it will be an irrelevant factor that in achieving the same some loss has been or may be caused to a particular industry. The view that we have taken finds support from the decision of the Supreme Court in Prag Ice & Oil Mill's case  (supra) where special emphasis has been laid on the said objectives. We do not think that the observation of the Supreme Court in Prag Ice & Oil Mill's case to the effect that the producer will in certain circumstances have to bear a loss has been made in the context, of abnormal situations, as contended by the learned Counsel for HINDALCO. It may be that there was some abnormal situation in the sense that there was illegal hoarding of mustard oil and an artificial rise in the price thereof. But whatever may be the situation, it is clear from that decision that the paramount consideration and dominant, object of Section 3 is the interest of the consumers and not of the industry.
 42. In Laxmi Khandsari v. State of U. P.,  the Supreme Court has reiterated the observation made in its earlier decision in Prag Ice & Oil Mill's case relating to the objects sought to be achieved by Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act and its view that there is no obligation to fix the price in such a way as to ensure reasonable profits to the producer or manufacturer. The question has been answered by the Supreme Court positively in New India Sugar Works v. State of U. P.,  That case was on the validity of the notification imposing levy on sugar. In that context Fazal Ali J. after reviewing the decisions on the point observed as follows (Para 4) :
 43. In view of the above decisions of the Supreme Court and particularly the decision in the case of New India Sugar Works, no challenge can be made to the impugned orders of the Government passed under the Control Order on the ground that HINDALCO has suffered loss. 
 44. We have so far proceeded on the assumption that HINDALCO has suffered a loss, for, as alleged by it, the retention price does not reflect all the increases in the prices of various inputs of production. We would however, like to state some significant facts. On Sept. 28, 1979 under a covering letter, HINDALCO submitted to the Controller of Aluminium a statement, showing the increase in the cost of production due to increase in the costs of raw materials, power and stores (Annexure IV to the affidavit-in-opposition). Rs. 3,275/- was shown to be the total increase on controlled items on account of raw materials, power, stores and sundries for each tonne of aluminium ingot. An additional increase in the cost of uncontrolled fabricated items was claimed in the, statement to be Rs. 400/- per tonne of such items. In the said letter it was stated that by way of an interim measure, HINDALCO increased the price of uncontrolled metal by Rs. 2,200/- per tonne pending revision of prices of aluminium by the Government, It was alleged that even after the increase in the price, the uncontrolled fabricated items still fall short of Rs. l,475/- per tonne, and the controlled items by Rupees 3,225/- per tonne as compared to the actual increase in the. cost of production, causing continued heavy losses. It was alleged, in para. 41 of the writ, petition that even after the sale and retention prices were fixed by the impugned orders, on a total production

and sale of 110 tonnes of aluminium metal per day, HINDALCO was suffering a cash loss of approximately Rs. 1.45 lakhs per day. 
 45. It was, however, pointed out by the appellants in para. 23 of their affidavit-in-opposition that since HINDALCO produced 25,000 tonnes of uncontrolled semi-fabricated items per annum the additional receipts on account of average increase in prices by Rs. 2,200/- per tonne would amount to Rs. 1.5 lakhs per day. Further, it was pointed out that HINDALCO again raised the prices of semi-fabricated items taking into account the increase in the prices by the impugned orders dated October 4, 1979. These increases, if, was averred, more than compensated HINDALCO of its alleged loss of 1.45 lakhs per day on account of the retention prices of the controlled items. It was alleged that HINDALCO's intention was to reap a double benefit by moving this Court praying for increase in the retention prices. In para. 18 of the affidavit-in-reply, HINDALCO admitted that after the revision of the sale and retention prices by the impugned orders it increased the prices of uncontrolled semi-fabricated items by Rs. 1,170/- -per tonne over and above the increase of Rs. 2,200/- per tonne effected immediately before the impugned orders were passed. Thus, after the passing of the impugned orders, the total increase that was made by HINDALCO in the prices of uncontrolled semi-fabricated items of aluminium was Rs. 3,370/- per tonne, that is to say above the total increase in the costs of the inputs of the controlled metal. The significant fact to be noticed is that while the appellants in para. 23 of their affidavit-in-opposition averred that in view of the increase by HINDALCO of the prices of uncontrolled semi-fabricated items by Rs. 2,200/-per tonne, HINDALCO got an additional receipt of Rs. 1.5 lakhs per day, the alleged loss being Rs. 1.45 lakhs per day was not denied in para. 18 of the affidavit-in-reply, although it wag alleged that losses suffered by it on controlled items had not been compensated at all. It was also not disclosed by HINDALCO in para. 23, what the daily additional receipt was consequent on the increase in the prices of uncontrolled items by Rs. 2,200/- per tonne, Moreover, it has been noticed already that HINDALCO further, increased the

prices of uncontrolled items by Rupees 1,170/- per tonne over and above Rs. 2,200/-. If after the increase by Rs. 2,200/- there was an additional receipt of Rs. 1.5 lakhs per day, the additional increase would surely amount to much more than Rs. 1.5 lakhs per day. Thus it is difficult to accept the case of HINDALCO that it was suffering a cash loss of Rs. 1.45 lakhs per day. 
 46. While we are on Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control Order, We may consider the case of HINDALCO that the said clauses are ultra vires Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act which is one of the grounds in the cross-objection. It is argued on behalf of HINDALCO that Clauses 4A and 4B impose a tax on the producers and/or manufacturers of aluminium without there being any specific provision in that regard in Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Ad. The contention made on behalf of HINDALCO is that as it has to pay the difference between the sale price and retention price in the Aluminium Regulation Account as provided in Clause 4B, such payment is tantamount, to an imposition of tax without any legislative sanction. The above contentions were also made before the learned Judge, but the learned Judge overruled the same. 
 47. Latham C. J. of the High Court of Australia has, in Mathews v. Chicory Marketing Boards 60 CLR 263 defined 'tax' as follows: 
 48. In support of his contention that the payment in the Aluminium Regulation Account is indirectly an imposition of tax, Mr. Ray has placed much reliance on a decision of the Privy Council in Lower Main Land Dairy Products Sales Adjustment Committee v. Crystal Diary, Limited, 1933 A. C. 168. What happened in that case was that because it was more profitable to dairy farmers in British Columbia to sell their milk in a fluid form than to sell products manufactured from it, there was congestion in the fluid milk market, caused by a shortage of demand. As a remedy, the Provincial Legislature passed the Daily Products Sales Adjustment Act, 1929 authorising the appointment of an adjustment. Committee. The Committee fixed monthly the standard prices for fluid milk and manufactured products. The farmers had to submit returns to the Committee as to the quantity of milk sold by them, and a farmer selling fluid milk had to pay to the Committee a levy assessed according to the quantity he sold. The total of these levies which together made up the difference in value of the milk disposed of in the two forms, was to be apportioned by the Committee among the farmers who had sold milk products. The expenses of the Committee were to be met by a further levy on the farmers. Both the levies were recoverable as debts, Lord Thankerton who delivered the iudgment of the Board observed as follows: 
 The statement of law and the essential characteristics of 'tax' as contained in the said observation of Lord Thankerton has been approved by the Supreme Court in the case of Venkata Subbarao v State of Andhra Pradesh .
 49. Relying upon the said decision of the Privy Council, 1933 A. C. 168, it is urged by the learned Counsel of HINDALCO that it should be held that Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control

Order impose a tax on the producers and manufacturers of aluminium by directing payment in the Aluminium Regulation Account the difference between the sale price and the retention price. In our opinion the facts of the said Privy Council case are different from those in the instant case. In the Privy Council case, the adjustment levies were assessed according to the quantity of milk sold by a farmer. Each farmer had to pay the adjustment levies out of the sale proceeds of milk. The money that was levied from each farmer was his money. It was compulsorily imposed and was enforceable by law. So there can be no doubt that there was compulsory exaction of money by a public authority for public purposes enforceable by law and was not payment for any services rendered. Thus the adjustment levies squarely came within the definition of 'tax' as given by Chief Justice Latham in Matthews v. Chicory Marketing Board (supra). In the instant case, mbney that is required to be paid by HINDALCO into the Aluminium Regulation Account, that is to say, the difference between the sale price and the retention price of aluminium, does not belong to HINDALCO. In order that a particular imposition can be characterised as tax, it must be proved that the amount that has to be paid belongs to the person from whom if is recovered. It is only the person entitled to a sum of money compulsorily recovered from him by any statutory authority can assail such recovery or imposition as 'tax' if it be without any legislative sanction. But a person who is merely the holder of the money for the time being but not entitled to the same cannot, in our opinion, assail the recovery of the same as tax, even if such recovery is without any legislative sanction, for, in such a case, there would be no element of exaction which is a sine qua non to the imposition being a tax. For these reasons, the earlier Privy Council case in the City of Halifox v. Nova Scotia Car Works Limited, 1914 AC 992 : (AIR 1914 PC 227 (2)) and the decision in Attorney-General v. Wills United Dairies Ltd., (1922) 127 LT 822 which have been relied on by Mr. Ray do not apply to the facts of the instant case. 
 50. It is not the case of the appellate that Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act authorises the imposition of any Tax, for, according to them, Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control Order do not seek to impose any tax on the aluminium producers or manufacturers. Section 3 does not at all contemplate an imposition of tax. It is no doubt true that without any express and specific authority of a statutory provision a tax cannot be imposed on any person. But as we have held that there is no exaction of money from HINDALCO or from any other producers or manufacturers of aluminium, the question of imposition of tax does not at all arise. 
 51. Realising the difficulty Mr. Ray has for the first time advanced an argument that the whole of the sale price including the retention price belongs to the producer concerned, namely, HINDALCO. In elaboration of this contention, the learned Counsel submits that Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act contemplates the fixation of one price, that is, the sale price which the seller is legally entitled, without any statutory interference to retain the entirety of the same received by him from the consumer. It is contended that 'retention price' as provided in the Control Order is a complete misnomer and is not envisaged by Section 3 of the Act, In a transaction of sale and purchase between the buyer and seller, the only factor that affects the transaction is the sale price and not the retention price. So it is submitted that the whole of the sale price belongs to the producer which is also borne out by the fact that it is the producer who is alone entitled to sue a customer for the realisation of unpaid sale price. Thus, Counsel for HINDALCO submits, to ask the producer to part with a portion of the sale price by payment of the same in the Aluminium Regulation Account is exaction of money and, as such. imposition of tax in the true sense of the term. It is urged that Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control Order providing for payment in the Aluminium Regulation Account the difference between the sale price and the retention price are ultra vires Section 3 of the Act inasmuch as Section 3 does not postulate fixation of retention price for payment of 3 portion of the sale price in the Aluminium Regulation Account. 
 52. The above contentions, in our opinion are fallacious. The objectives under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act Cinder which the Control Order has been passed are maintenance or increase in supplies or equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of any essential commodity. To achieve these objectives, Section 3 authorises the Central Government to pass orders regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution of any essential commodity and trade and commerce therein. What Section 3 aims at is that the essential commodity should, be made available to the consumers at a fair price. Fixation, of fair price only will not necessarily render the essential commodity available to the consumers, In order to make the essential commodity available to the consumers at a fair price, not only the fair price has to be fixed but, if there is no adequate simply of the essential commodity, supply thereof has to be increased. 
 53. The Government has fixed the sale price of indigenous aluminium which is considered to be fair and within the pecuniary limits of the consumers. The cost of production of HIN-DALCO is lower than the sale price but it is higher so far as BALCO and MALCO are concerned. If BALCO and MALCO have to sell aluminium at the sale price without any subsidy, they will have to close their business, for they cannot be compelled to produce and sell aluminium at a perpetual loss, Closure of their business would seriously, affect, the supply and availability of aluminium. If the supply of Aluminium is such that it cannot meet the demand, mere fixation of the sale price would serve no purpose of the consumers and, consequently, the objectives under Section 3 of the Act cannot be achieved. In order to obviate this difficulty the concept of retention price normally reflecting the cost of production has been introduced. As the retention price fixed for HINDALCO is lower than the sale price, it has to pay to the Aluminium Regulation Account the sum which is the difference between the sale price and the retention price. Such sum will be paid to BALCO and MALCO as subsidy making up the losses that might be suffered by them or, in other words, making up the difference between their respective retention prices and the sale price. Thus, it appears that the steps taken by the Government by the fixation of a retention price for each producer and the sale

price and the provision for payment to the Aluminium Regulation Account were necessary in the interests of the consumers so as to maintain supply of aluminium consistent with the demand therefor and to make it available to the consumers at a fair price. 
 54. It is not correct to say that Section 3 of the Act contemplates fixation of one price, that is, the sale price and no other price. In Diwan Sugar Mills v. Union of India,  it has been observed by the Supreme Court that it is perfectly legitimate for the Government, keeping in mind the object of availability at fair price, to fix different prices at different stages but only the price at one of the stages depending upon the Government's estimate of the situation, would serve the object of the Act. In the instant case, the Government, has fixed one sale price at which the essential ccommodity namely, aluminium will be sold to the consumers. It is true that the Government has also fixed for each producer a retention. price which a producer will be entitled to get out of the sale price. Fixation of retention prices is necessary for the purpose of fulfilling the object of availability of aluminium at a fair price. We are un-able to accept the contention or the. learned Counsel for HINDALCO that, Government has no power to fix retention prices. Such power can be found, in Section 3 itself and that is the regulatory power of the Government. It is obvious -that the power to regulate has been conferred on the Government in order to achieve the objects of Section 3. It has been already discussed that if retention prices are not fixed and no payment is required to be made to the Aluminium Regulation Account, there would be no supply commensurate with the demand and, consequently, non-availability of the commodity at a fair price. Thus it was incumbent upon the Government to fix the retention prices for different producers and provide for payment to the Aluminium Regulation Account. The expression 'regulation' in Section 3 of the Act should be given a liberal interpretation (See P. P. Enterprises v. Union of India ). Thus unless it is manifestly unjust, any action by the Government in exercise of its regulatory power in the matter of availability of any essential commodity at a

fair price will be perfectly legal and justified. For all this we hold that the provisions for fixation of retention prices and for payment in the Aluminium Regulation Account are quite legal and valid.
 55. There is no substance in the contention of HINDALCO that it is entitled to the whole of the sale price.
No such claim was ever made by. it be
fore, for it could not be made. The
claim has been made for the first time
before us with a view to characterising
the payment in the Aluminium Regulation Account as exaction of money
amounting to imposition of tax. It has
been found already that such payment is not tax, for HINDALCO is not
entitled to the whole of the sale price.
It is only entitled to the retention price
as fixed by the Government, which is
less than the sale price. It may be that
for the time being a producer whose
retention price is less than the sale
price holds the whole of the sale price
and, in case of non-payment of the
sale price by a consumer, the producer
will be entitled to institute a legal ac
tion for the realisation of the same
but that is no consideration justifying a
claim by the producer to the whole of
the sale price. The sum of money in
excess of the sale price is held by the
producer concerned to the credit of the
Aluminium Regulation Account so long
as it is noi deposited in that Account.
The view which we have taken, that the
money that is required to be paid by
HINDALCO to the Aluminium Regula
tion Account does not belong to it, nor
is it by way of imposition of tax,
finds support from the decision of the
Delhi High Court in B D. Aggarwala v.
Union of India, ILR (1974) 2 Delhi 520.
(The above contentions made on behalf
of HINDALCO are, accordingly, over
filled. 
 56. At this stage we shall refer to a contention of the learned Additional Solicitor-General that unless any money realised by the Government goes to the Consolidated Fund, it cannot be regarded as tax. It is submitted that as the amounts deposited in the Aluminium Regulation Account do not go to the Consolidated Fund but are, distributed among certain producers of aluminium, such amounts' cannot be on account of any tax imposed by the Government. In support of, the contention, the learned Additional Solicitor-General has placed

reliance upon the provision of Article 266 of the Constitution and a few decisions of the Supreme Court, namely, Hingir-Rampur Coal Company v State of Orissa, ; Govt. of Madras v. Zenith Lamps & Etectricals Ltd. ; State of Rajasthan v. Sajjan Lal,  and Southern Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals v. State of Kerala . In view of our finding that the money which HINDALCO is required to pay in the Aluminium. Regulation Account does not belong to it and, consequently, there being no exaction of
such money, it is not tax, it is hardly necessary for us to consider the contention that as the money does not go to the Consolidated Fund it does not partake of the character of tax.
 57. The third proviso of Clause 4 (1), Clause 4A, the first proviso to Clause 4B (3) and the proviso to Clause 4B (4) of the Control Order provide for the fixation of sale and retention prices with regard to the unwrought aluminium transferred by a producer from one place to another, namely, to his auxi-liary plant and payment of the differ-ence between these prices either in or out of the Aluminium Regulation Account. It appears that the Control Order has made a distinction between a producer and a manufacturer. A producer is one who produces aluminium from bauxite or alumina. A manufacturer is one who manufactures aluminium, that is to say aluminium of different specifications. The manufacturers of al-minium purchase aluminium ingots from the producers for the purpose of manufacture of different aluminium goods. These purchases are to be made at the sale price fixed by the Government under the Control Order. HINDALCO is both a producer and a manufacturer of aluminium. It has auxiliary plants for processing un-wrought indigenous aluminium into aluminium of different specifications, such as sheets, circles, sections etc. Under the third proviso of Clause 4 (1) of the Control Order, the Government has been authorised to fix the sale price and under Clause 4A the retention prices per tonne of unwrought indigenous aluminium produced and transferred by a producer to his auxiliary plant for fur-ther precessing arid sale as indigenous aluminium of different specifications such transfer being deemed to be a sale

under the Explanation to Clause 3 (1) of the Control Order. So sale and retention prices have been fixed by the Government in respect of unwrought aluminium which is transferred by HINDALCO to its auxiliary plants for further processing into aluminium of different specifications mentioned above. The contention that has been put forward on behalf of HINDALCO is that as no sale actually takes place, the Government has no authority to treat the transfer of unwrought indigenous aluminium to the auxiliary plants as sale and fix the sale and retention prices. Further it is submitted that in the case of deemed sale, the provision for payment of the difference between the sale price and the retention price into the Aluminium Regulation Account is exaction of money in the true sense of the term and such payment should be construed as imposition of tax. It is submitted that Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act does not empower the Government to treat the transfer of unwrought aluminium by a producer to his auxiliary plants as sale when actually no sale takes place and to fix the sale and retention prices for the purpose of payment in the Aluminium Regulation Account. Accordingly, it is contended that the said provisions of the Control Order are null and void. 
 58. Two questions arise for our consideration. First, whether, when unwrought aluminium is transferred by a producer to his auxiliary plant for further processing into aluminium of different specifications, such transfer can be deemed to be a sale. Second, whether the payment of the difference between the sale price and the retention price can be regarded as imposition of tax. 
 59. When a producer is also a manufacturer, he will not have to purchase unwrought aluminium for the purpose of manufacturing aluminium goods, but a manufacturer who is not a producer of aluminium has to purchase unwrought aluminium from a producer at a sale price fixed by the Government under the Control Order. The cost of production of aluminium goods by such a manufacturer will be much higher than that of a manufacturer who is a producer. Naturally, the producer who is also a manufacturer will be in a position to sell aluminium goods to the consu-
mers at a much lesser price than a manufacturer who is not a producer. So the manufacture and sale of aluminium goods would be the monopoly of a manufacturer who is also a producer. The businesses of other manufacturers will have to be closed down, for it would be impossible for them to compete with a producer who is also a manufacturer. Consequently, there will be a great set back in the aluminium industry and the object of Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, namely for maintaining or increasing supplies of aluminium or for securing its equitable distribution and availability at, fair price, would be frustrated. The provisions of the impugned clauses of the Control Order are obviously to equalise the cost of unwrought aluminium of the producers of aluminium with that of other manufacturers of aluminium. It is true that prima facie there is no element of sale when unwrought aluminium is transferred by a producer to his auxiliary plants for the purpose of manufacturing aluminium of different specifications. But in order to obviate the inequality in the cost of unwrought aluminium, a producer who is also a manufacturer has been treated as two different entities, namely (1) as a producer and (2) as a manufacturer. As a manufacturer, he has been placed in the same position as other manufacturers, so that one producer is not treated differently from another and one manufacturer is not treated differently from another manufacturer. In case no provision had been made for fixation of sale and retention prices of unwrought aluminium transferred to his auxiliary plant by a producer, the whole of the Control Order would have been ineffective and, in any case, would have resulted in discriminatory treatments between a producer who is also a manufacturer and a manufacturer who is not a producer. A producer and a manufacturer of aluminium are two distinct and separate categories of persons and each category is entitled to be treated alike. 
 60. The question however, is whether the Government has power to treat or deem such transfer to be a sale. It has been already discussed if the transfer had not been treated as a sale, the Control Order would have been unworkable and, moreover, it would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution so far as manufacturers of aluminium goods are concerned. Section 3 of the Act does not provide for any such 'deemed sale' as contended on behalf of HINDALCO, but for the purpose of achieving the objects underlying Section 3, the Government has been conferred with the power of regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution of any essential commodity and trade and commerce therein. Further, under Clause (f) of Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act Government may direct any producer to sell the whole of a specified part of the quantity of any essential commodity held in stock or produced or received by a producer to it or to its officer or agent or to a Corporation owned by it or to a person or class of persons. In view of Clause (f), it would have been quite legal for the Government to direct the producers of aluminium to sell the entire quantity of unwrought aluminium to the Government, and that if any producer would like to manufacture aluminium goods, he would have to re-purchase unwrought aluminium from the Government at a price which may be the difference between the sale price and the retention price. By deeming a transfer of unwrought aluminium to the auxiliary plam of a producer to be a sale the Government has, in our opinion, proceeded in the light of the provision of Clause (f) of Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act, though not strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. If any such order in terms of Clause (f) had been passed by the Government strictly in accordance with the terms of Clause (f) it would have been, to some extent, inconvenient for the producers as that would have delayed production of aluminium goods on account of compliance with the formalities of sale and re-purchase of unwrought aluminium. By deeming a transfer to be a sale, the Government appears to have acted for the benefit and convenience of the producers who are also manufacturers of aluminium goods. We do not think that any objection can be taken on the ground that the Government has no power to deem a transfer to be a sale. It may be that Clause 3 of the Control Order under which a transfer of unwrought aluminium to the auxiliary plants of a producer shall be deemed to be a sale is not strictly in accordance with the provision of Clause (f) of Sub-section (2) of Section 3. But in considering the propriety and validity of such a provision, the Court will look to the substance of the provision and the object which it. seeks to achieve rather than to its form. So we do not think that any illegality has been committed by the Government in fixing the sale and retention prices of unwrought aluminium after it is transferred by a producer to his auxiliary plants for manufacture of aluminium of different specifications, and the payment of the difference between the sale price and the retention price in the Aluminium Regulation Account, deeming such transfer to be a sale. There is therefore, no substance in the contention made on behalf of HINDALCO that the Government has no authority to deem the transfer of aluminium to be a sale as there is no element of the contract of sale and purchase. 
 61. The answer to the second question will not detain us long. As soon as it is found that the provision of the Control Order providing for the fixation of sale and retention prices of aluminium ingots transferred by a producer to his auxiliary plants is legal and valid, the payment that a producer has to make in the Aluminium Regulation Account cannot be regarded as tax. For the same reasons as given earlier, in this case also, there will be no question of exaction of money. The contentions of HINDALCO are, accordingly overruled. 
 62. The next contention of HIN-DALCO is that the fixation of sale and retention prices of wire rods called 'properzi rods' is null and void because (i) it is in violation of Section 3(3) of the Essential Commodities Act and consequently, the first proviso to Clause 4 (1), and Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control Order; (ii) if, is not in accordance with Clause 4A of the Control Order, for the fixation of conversion cost of properzi rods has been made on the basis of weighted average of the cost of conversion of all the four primary aluminium producers; and (iii) it is contrary to Clause 4A of the Control Order, for properzi rods are not produced but they are manufactured. 
 63. Contentions (i) and (iii) have, however been not pressed by Mr. Ray, learned Counsel for HINDALCO. He has, however, strenuously urged the second contention. Clauses 4A of the Control Order provides as follows:
 64. It is contended that under Clause 4A, separate retention prices have to be fixed for each producer in respect of goods manufactured by him from unwrought aluminium. The properzi rods are manufactured by HINDALCO and also by the other three producers. It is complained by HINDALCO that in fixing its retention prices in respect of properzi rods, the cost of conversion of unwrought aluminium into properzi rods has been taken by the Government uniformly for all the four producers fixing the same at the sum of Rs. 335/- per tonne on the basis of weighted average of the cost of conversion of all the producers. Such fixation of conversion cost, Counsel for HINDALCO submits, is in violation of Clause 4A of the Control Order under which the conversion cost has to be fixed separately in respect of each producer. It is the case of HINDALCO that its actual cost of conversion is Rs. 530/- per metric tonne which should have been taken into consideration in fixing the retention price and that, accordingly, it has suffered loss for the fixation of Rs. 335/- as the conversion cost on an illegal basis. It has however, been pointed out by the learned Additional Solicitor-General that the basis of fixation of conversion cost has not been challenged in the writ petition. Such challenge has been made in the affidavit-in-reply. It is submitted on behalf, of HINDALCO, that as it was not aware of the basis of fixation of conversion cost, it could not take the point in the writ petition, but after it was disclosed in the affidavit-in-op-position of the Government, the point has been taken assailing the adoption of the basis of weighted average for the determination of the conversion cost. 
 65. It appears that separate retention
prices have been fixed for each producer as required by Section 4A of the
Control Order. In fixing the retention
price, the conversion cost was deter
mined on the basis of weighted average
of such cost of all the producers. It
further appears that in 1978 the con
version cost that was also fixed on the
basis of weighted average was Rs. 335/-
per tonne. The said amount has also been
taken to be the conversion cost for the
period in question. It is difficult to accept that HINDALCO was not aware
of the basis of determination of the con
version cost. There can be no doubt
that the conversion cost should have
been determined separately for each
producer, but merely because it has been
done on the basis of weighted average,
it cannot, be struck down unless it has
resulted in loss to HINDALCO. If is
only alleged by HINDALCO that its
actual cost of conversion :is Rs. 530/-
per tonne, but it has not disclosed how
much loss it has suffered on account of
fixation of conversion cost of Rs. 335/-
per tonne. It is not in dispute that the
licensed capacity of HINDALCO for. properzi rods has been increased from
12,000 tonnes to 22,000 tonnes. There is
some controversy as to whether the in
crease of the licensed capacity is legal
or not. There is some substance in the
contention of the learned Additional
Solicitor-General that if HINDALCO had
been suffering a loss on account of the
conversion cost having been fixed at
Rs. 335/- per tonne, it would not have
increased its licensed capacity nor would
it have manufactured properzi rods to
the extent of 25,000 tonnes. As HIN
DALCO has not disclosed how much loss
it has suffered on account of low fixa
tion of conversion cost, as alleged by it,
it is difficult to hold that HINDALCO
has suffered loss. This, in our opinion,
cannot be a ground for directing the
Central Government to re-consider the
fixation of retention price of properzi
rods. 
 66. It is not in dispute that the in-crease in the retention price for unwrought aluminium of HINDALCO by Rs. 655/- per tonne is on account of the increase in the electric power rates. It has been already stated that the sources of electric power of HINDALCO are
U.P. State Electricity Board and Renu-sagar which is a subsidiary of HIN-
DALCO. The case of HINDALCO is that

the cost of Henusagar power was totally ignored by the Government, and that in dealing with the cost of U. P. State Electricity Board supply, the Government had acted arbitrarily and subjected HINDALCO to hostile discrimination. HINDALCO claims that there has been an increase in the cost of power to the extent of Rs. 1,104,45, that is, at the rate of 5.97 paise per unit. On the other hand, the Government has claimed that full increase in the cost of power has been reflected in the said sum of Rupees 665/- in the retention price. 
 67. In the statement of calculations which has been annexed to the writ petition [(Annexure 5 (4)] HINDALCO claims that there has been an increase of 5.97 paise per unit. In support of bis contention that the increase in the power rales of both the U. P. State Electricity Board and Renusagar have been reflected in the said sum of Rupees 655/- per tonne of aluminium, the learned Additional Solicitor-General submits that as according to the Government one paise increase in the cost of power resulted in an increase of Rupees 170/- per tonne of unwrought aluminium the increase of the retention price by Rs. 655/- granted by the Government represented an increase at the rate of about 3.85 paise per unit of power over and above the previous rates allowed by the Government. In the annual report of the Board of Directors of HINDALCO, if, is stated, inter alia, that one paise increase in the rate of power per unit would result in an increase of Rs. 180/- in the cost of unwrought aluminium per tonne, although in the writ petition it has been claimed to be Rs. 200/-. It is submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor-General that even on the basis of Rs. 180/-, the increase in the cost of power as represented by the said sum of Rs. 655/-would be at the rate of 3.64 paise per unit which is slightly less. The learned Additional Solicitor-General has however, refuted the contention of HINDALCO that there has been an increase at the rate of 5.97 paise per unit of power. 
 68. It is apparent from the Press Note dated October 5 1979 that the Government decided to reflect the entire increase in the costs of power. It is, however, difficult to come to any finding whether, the Government has, as a

matter of fact, included in the retention price of unwrought aluminium of HINDALCO, the whole of the increase in the cost of power of both the sources. There can be no doubt that in view of the said decision of the Government, it should include in the retention price the entire increase in the power rates. 
 69.   We may   however, proceed on the
assumption that the increase in the power rate of Renusagar has not been included in the retention price fixed for HINDALCO. In other words, the said sum of Rs. 655/- does not reflect the full cost of power. The question, however, is whether on this ground we shall be justified in directing reconsideration by the Government of the fixation of retention price as has been directed by the learned Judge. We have earlier repelled the contention of HINDALCO that on account of low fixation of the retention prices it had been suffering ]oss of Rs. 1.45 lakhs every day. Again, we may assume that HINDALCO had suffered loss as the entire increase in the power rates has not been reflected in the retention price. Alleging that it had been suffering loss HINDALCO withheld payment in the Aluminium Regulation Account. It appears from the balance sheet for the year 1979 that a sum of Rs. 6,06.65,8.71/- has been set apart for the Aluminium Regulation Account. The balance sheet for the year 1980 reveals that a sum of Rs. 14,30,44,230/- has been kept back for the Aluminium Regulation Account. The total amount which has been withheld by HINDALCO is Rs. 20,37,10,101/- which, it may be presumed, has been invested by HIN-DALCO. The minimum interest which HINDALCO can reasonably be presumed to have earned, by such investment is 10% which would mean on amount of interest of Rs. 2,03,07,000/- every year. For the last four years, the said sum stands withheld and the total amount of interest, which HINDALCO has earned must be, in the minimum, more than Rupees 8.00,00,000/-. Even assuming that HINDALCO had suffered loss, by withholding the said amount for payment in
the     Aluminium Regulation Account it has earned more than Rs. 8,00,00,000/-and as such, today the question of suffering of any loss by HINDALCO
for the period in question, that is, for seventeen months does not arise. So even if the retention price has not included the whole of the increase in the

cost   of  power   from    the    above    two
sources, we do not think that the retention and sale prices fixed by the Government should be set aside and the Government should be asked to reconsider the same as has been done by the learned Judge. In the circumstances, we do not find any merit in the contention of HINDALCO that as the full increase in the cost of power has not been included in the retention prices, the Government should be directed not to insist on the payment in the Aluminium Regulation Account till the retention price is re-fixed by the Government for the period in question after due consideration of the increase in the cost of of production including the increase to the cost of power. 
 70. Before we part with this appeal, we may dispose of some other contentions of HINDALCO. It is contended that Clauses 4A and 4B of the Control Order are ultra vires Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 265 and 300A of the Constitution. It is also urged that the impugned orders are discriminatory inasmuch as while the Government has allowed to other producers the entire increase in the cost of power rates, it has only allowed to HINDALCO 40% of such increase. The validity of the impugned orders have, accordingly, been challenged as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Further, it is contended that as HINDALCO has not been given an opportunity of being heard, before the impugned orders were passed they are violative of the rules of natural justice and are void. 
 71. We do not think that there is any substance in the above contentions. We have failed to appreciate how the impugned clauses of the Control Order are violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 265 and 300A of the Constitution. The Control Order has been passed under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. In our opinion, as the impugned provisions of the Control Order are quite consistent, with the provision of Section 33 of the Act, there is no question of their teeing violative of any of the provision of the Constitution, regard being had to the fact that the Constitutional validity of Section 3 has not been challenged by HINDALCO. It is said that HINDALCO has been discriminated against at least in respect of the increase in the cost of power. Whether the retention price fixed for HINBALCO reflects the whole of the increase in the cost of power supplied to it by the U. P. State Electricity Board and Renusagar is a disputed question of fact which cannot be gone into in a proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution. It has been already pointed out by us that even if the entire increase in the cost of power was net included in the retention price that has not prejudiced HINDALCO, for it has earned a considerable amount of interest on the amount payable by it to the Aluminium Regulation Account. AS regards the contention that HINDALCO should have been given an opportunity of being heard before the impugned orders were passed, we do not think that there is any merit in the contention. HINDALCO itself made representation to the BICP which considered such representations. The recommendations of BICP were placed before the Government, and it can be reasonably presumed that the Government, after considering such representations and the recommendations of the BICP, passed the impugned orders. Therefore, it cannot be said that HINDALCO was not heard. We are unable to accept the contention that HINDALCO should have been given a personal hearing. HINDALCO never asked for a personal hearing, nor do we think that any such hearing was necessary. As the Government had considered the written representations of HINDALCO which contained in details its grievances, there was no violation of the rules of natural justice. 
 72. For the reasons aforesaid, we set aside the judgment of the learned Judge, dismiss the writ petition and discharge the Rule Nisi. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed and the cross-objection is dismissed. HINDALCO is granted six weeks' time from date to pay to the Aluminium Regulation Account all amounts payable by it to the said Account for the period in question. There will be no order as to costs. 
 73. A prayer has been made on behalf of HINDALCO for a certificate for appeal to the Supreme Court under Article 134A of the Constitution. In this connection it may be said that all the questions of law have been decided by us wife reference to the decisions of the Supreme Court as also of the decisions of the other High Courts and the Privy Council. 
 74. In the circumstances, we do not think that it is a fit case for the grant of a certificate for appeal to the Supreme Court. The prayer for a certificate is, accordingly, disallowed.

to the inter action of the provisions of Section 95(1)(b),  Motor Vehicles Act,  (hereafter, the Act),  &  of Rule 118, Bombay Motor Vehicle Rules;
and their impact on the liability of the Insurance Company for the death or bodily  injury to the  hirer of a goods vehicle when he is a passenger in the same vehicle. 
  2. The  Accidents Claim  Tribunal has taken the view that when a person hires a goods vehicle for transport of of his goods and  when he is a passenger on the vehicle, then the Insurance Policy taken by the owner of the goods vehicle need not cover the loss caused to such passenger by virtue of the goods vehicle need not cover the loss caused to such passenger by virtue of the negligence of his driver and hence the Insurance Company is not liable to such passenger for payment of compensation to him.  We are required to examine the correctness of this view. 
  3. The facts of the case are more or less admitted.  When some of the facts are in dispute, we will indicate the nature of the dispute at the appropriate place.  The facts are as follows : 
  4. It was in these circumstances that the application for compensation was filed by the claimant before the Accidents Tribunal for recovery of compensation totally amounting to Rs. 77,500/-.  Out of this compensation, a sum of Rupees 9,953.25 ps.  Was claimed as special damages for the medical expenses and expenses connected with the medical expenses such as conveyance charges etc.  The balance of the amount was claimed as damages for pains and sufferings, loss of income and general damages for loss of life-enjoyment.  The claim was made against respondent 1 being the owner of vehicle 'B' and against the Insurance Company with whom the said truck 'B' was insured.  They were arrayed as Opposite Parties Nos.  1 and 3 respectively.  The claim was made also against the owner of truck 'A' and the Insurance Company who were arrayed as respondents 1 to 4, respondents 1 & 2 being the owners of vehicles 'B'  &  'A' respectively and respondents 3 & 4  being the insurers of vehicles 'B' & 'A' respectively.  The claimant's contention in the application was that the collision between the two vehicles was the result of the negligence on the part of the part of the drivers of both the vehicles.  Hence he claimed the said amount of Rs.  7,500/-jointly and severally from both the owners and from both the Insurance Companies concerned.. 
  5. Both respondents 1 and  2 denied the allegation of negligence on the part of their respective drivers.  On these pleadings, issues were framed by the Tribunal and parties went to trial and led their evidence.  The  claimant examined him-self as also the police officer who had made panchanama of also got duly proved through the said officer.  On behalf of respondent 1, the cleaner who was accompanying the  driver of the truck 'B' at the relevant time was examined.  No evidence was led on behalf of respondent 2.  Even the drive of truck 'A' was not examined. 
  6. After examining all the above mentioned evidence, oral and documentary, the tribunal found that the collision between the two vehicles  was the direct result of the gross negligence on the part of the driver of truck 'A'.  He absolved the driver of truck 'B' of negligence.  As regards the quantum of compensation, the tribunal held that damages, both general as well as special, to the extent of Rs. 33,000/- were proved by the claimant.  Hence, he passed and award for the said sum of Rs. 33,00/- in favour of the claimant together with costs which were quantified at Rupees 200/-. 
  7. However, the tribunal further held that the policy of insurance given by respondent 4 was not required to cover the risk to life or body of the owner of the goods, who had hired the truck for transportation of the  goods and who was the passenger in the truck.  This conclusion was arrived  at by the tribunal principally upon the reasoning that under S. 95, Motor Vehicles Act, the risk to a bona fide employee of he hirer of the truck for his goods was required to********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************this reasoning that the above mentioned conclusion vis-a-vis the liability of the Insurance Company, respondent 4, was arrived at by the trial Court.  A decree for the said  sum of Rs.  33,000/-  was, therefore, made executable by the Tribunal against respondent 2 and against no one else. 
  8. It may be mentioned here that about one factual position there existed no  dispute before us.  The factual position resulting from the nature of the decree passed by the tribunal is that the  decree obtained by the claimant is more or less a paper decree.  As stated by Shri Kudrolli, the learned Advocate appearing for the claimant before us, and not seriously disputed by Mr.  Chaphekar appearing for the Insurance Company, respondent 4, truck 'A' which met with the accident was an old, dilapidated, worn out truck even at the time of the accident itself.  It was further damaged by virtue of the accident.  Respondent 2 sold away the same almost as junk after the date of the accident.  The resultant position as at present is that there is no property which respondent 2 is known to be having against which property the decree obtained by the claiment, can be executed.  Unless, there-fore, the decree obtained by the claimant, can be executed.  Unless, therefore, the decree is passed either against respondent 4, the decree  becomes nothing but a paper decree in the hands of the maimed claimant. 
  9.   The last mentioned fact probably explains the reason  why respondent 2 against whom the decree is passed has not cared to file any appeal against the same.  Even before the Tribunal, no apperance was filed on behalf of him.  Opposite Party 4, the Insurance Company, with whom said truck 'A' was in sured took part in the cross-examination of the material witness but only to the extent of their liability under the policy.  As regards appeal against the award of the Tribunal, only to the extent of their liability under the policy.  As regards appeal against the award of the Tribunal, only the claimant has filed appeal against the above order contending that the amount of compensation awarded to the claimant is extremely inadequate. 
  10. Mr.  Kudrolli, the learned Advocate appearing for the appellant urged three points before us. 
  11. They are:  
  12. It may be mentioned that the last mentioned point was the main point on which extensive and elaborate arguments were advanced and that is the point which is referred to at the outset of this judgment.  However, we will deal with all the points in the order mentioned above. 
  13. So far as the first question relating to the quantum of liability is concerned, Mr.  Kudrolli was fair enough to concede that the Tribunal's Award does not suffer from any error so far as the Award relates to re-compensing the claimant for the expense incurred on medical and allied grounds.  His main grievance was relating to: 
  14. As regards compensation for loss of income was concerned, Mr.  Kudrolli pointed out that the claimant's statement that his monthly income was Rs.  500/- was accepted by the tribunal Likewise, he pointed out that he had no quarrel with the Tribunal's finding that once the shop which the claimant was running was let out or given over by the claimant to some one else for running the same, and once it was established that the claimant was receiving Rupees 300/- per month as rent or compensation as the case may be for the said shop, the reduction in the claimant's monthly income was only by rs.  200/- and that would be the quantum that could be claimed by him as the future monthly  income.  He had also no quarrel with the proposition that the period of 8 years taken by the tribunal as the future period of earning is reasonable period.  However, Mr.  Kudrolli, pointed out that as per the evidence on record, which had gone unchallenged, the claimant was successful in letting out the shop only about 4 years after the date of the accident; the accident took place on 19-8-1973.  He invited our attention  to the claimant's evidence where he has stated that the tribunal has awarded compensation for the loss of income for the first year from the date of the accident at Rs.  5000/- per year and he had no quarrel with that finding.  But according to him, the reduction of Rupees 300/- per month, that is to say, Rupees 3600/- per year has been made by the tribunal from the very second year.  Mr. Kudrolli contended that there exists no evidencde on record to hold that the claimant had given over the shop and had started earning income from the same at the rate of Rs. 300/- per month immediately from the next year.  He contended that for the further period of 3 years the loss of income should have been computed not at the rate of Rupees 1400/- per year as was done by the tribunal, but at the rate of Rs. 5000/- per year as was done for the first year.  He had no quarrel with the finding that for the further period of 4 years the loss should be computed at Rs. 1400/- per  annum.  Thus, he claims rs. 3600/- per year for 3 more years which amount was denied to him by the Tribunal, meaning thereby, he claims an additional sum of Rs. 10/300/- for the loss of in-income for the total period of 4 years from the date of the accident. 
  15. We have gone through the evidence on record.  From the claimant's admission in the evidence, we find that according to him he himself was in possession of the shop till the year 1976.  This means that not for 4 years but for 3 years from the date of the accident the claimant was losing the monthly income of Rs. 5000/-.  If the evidence on record is believed, it cannot be said that till the end of the year 1976 the claimant was earning anything from the shop, because the possession of the shop was given over by him after the year 1976.  It will be, therefore, reasonable to hold that till the year 1976 the claimant was deprived of the income which he was earning.  This makes the total period at the most to 3 years, if not less.  To err on the safer side, we hold that it would be for the peiod of 3 years and not less.  But even then, the total loss that can be computed would be Rupees 15,000/-.  Out of this, a sum of Rupees 7,800/- is claimant, therefore, should be entitled to a sum of Rs.  7,200/- on this account. 
  16. We may state here that Mr.  Chaphekar, the learned Advocate for responsdent 4, the Company who had insured truck 'A', fairly stated before the Court that the evidence on record relied upon by Mr.  Kudrolli must lead the Court to this conclusion.  In this view of the matter.  It must be held that the claimant is entitled to an additional compensation of rs. 7,200/-. 
  17. So far as the second point urged by Mr. Kudrolli is concerned, we do not find any material with which we can find fault with the view taken by the Tribunal, namely that for pains and  sufferings and for loss of enjoyment of life the amount of Rs.  15,000/-would be adequate.  It can hardly be gainsaid that while computing these general damages some element of arbitrariness is inescapable.  It is true that the Tribunal has not given any indication as to upon what principle the amount of Rupees 15,000/- was fixed by it.  But from the very nature of things, no hard and fast rule can be laid down for fixing such compensation.  Mr. Kudrolli was unable to indicate any principle upon which we could interfere with the finding recorded and conclusion arrived at by the tribunal.  With all the sympathy for the claimant, we find no legal basis on which we can find fault with the finding.  We are, therefore, unable to interfere with this finding of the Tribunal. 
  18. This brings us to the main question arising in this appeal which is referred  to at the outset in the judgment.  The question as to whether the   Tribunal was justified in reading the Act in such a manner that the Insurance  Company, respondent 4, was exonerated  of its liability for the negligence committed by the driver of truck 'A' which was insured with the Company towards one of the passengers of the truck. 
  19. We may briefly state here the reasoning that prevailed upon  the tribunal for absolving  respondent 4 of its liability.  When we say that the tribunal absolved respondent 4 of its liability as per its insurance policy at all, towards the claimant for any act of negligence committed by the driver of truck 'A' in which the claimant as a hirer of the truck was a passenger.  Briefly speaking, the Tribunal relied upon the provisions of Clause (ii) of the proviso to S. 95 (1) of the Act and has held that the risk involved for the hirer of the vehicle hired by him for carriage of his goods was not required  to be covered by any insurance policy if the hirer was one of the passengers in the truck.  The Tribunal has construed the said proviso to mean that if the hirer's employees were being carried by truck 'A' at the time when the truck  was hired by the claimant, the insurance policy would have to cover the risk to such employees of the hirer, but for the hirer himselfl, if he was one of the passengers of the truck, there was no statutory obligation upon the owner of the truck to insure the risk so far as the death or bodily injury to such hirer was concerned. 
  20. For coming to this conclusion, the tribunal has mainly relied upon certain decisions of the other High Courts to which we will presently refer.  We have to examine whether the said authorities lead to any such conclusion and if any one of them does lead to any such conclusion, then whether such conclusion could be agreed with by us. 
  21. Before examining the said authorities, however, it is necessary to refer to and  analyse the statutory provision which, it is contended, gives rise to such a result.  The most relevant provision which, it is contended, gives rise to such a  result.  The most relevant  provision which, it is contended, gives rise to such a result.  The most relevant provision in this connection is Section 95 of the Act.  The relevant part of the same can be fruitfully set out here.  The relevant portion of the same is as follows:- 
  22. From the above provision, it is clear that certain risks which are inevitably involved in the transport of motor vehicles are compulsorily required to be insured under the Act by the owner of the vehicle concerned.  The analysis of the above section shows that as per Clause (b)  (I) of said Section 95 (1) the policy of insurance which is compulsory for owner to take must insure any person against any liability which may be incurred by the owner of the vehicle for death or bodily injury to such person.   In other words, if said  Clause (b) (I) of said S. 95 (1) remains as it is, the owner of the truck 'B' in which the claimant who was the hirer of the truck was the passenger, would be under the statutory  obligation to insure the risk involved to the claimant even as a passenger of the truck.  So far as this much legal position is concerned, we may state here that there can be no doubt about this position and in fact there was no dispute about this  legal position before us.  The only question that arises is as to whether there is any exception to this statutory obligation contained in said Clause (b) (i) of Section 95 (1) carved in any other provision of the Act.  Contention before the tribunal, and before us as well as before the various other High Courts was that Clause 9ii0  of the proviso to said Section 95 (1) carved out such exception.  The proviso is already set out, above.  It states that unless a vehicle is a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment, it will not be necessary to insure against the death or bodily injury of any passenger in the vehicle.  In other words, said Clause (ii) of the said proviso not only  carves out an exception to the general rule contained in sub-clause (ii) of Clause (b) to Section 95 (1) but it also carves out an exception to the exception.  The first exception is that so far as the passengers in the vehicle are concerned, there need not be any coverage for the risk to  their lives or bodies.  If  this exception stood all by itself, then it would mean that sub-clause (ii)  to Clause (b) of S. 95 (1) did not require any insurance policy being taken for the passengers of the vehicle concerned.  This would mean that the risk insured against was the risk to the outsider or what in popular parlance (is) known as third party and not to the passengers carried in the vehicle.  This would perhaps be in  consonance with the earlier well-known maxim of Roman Law of Volenti Non Fit Injuria, meaning thereby, that the passenger who had undertaken to travel with the owner of the car or with the owner's agent could not make complaint about the injury caused to himself by virtue of the latter's negligence because he had voluntarily accepted the risk.  But as it is well known, this maxim of Volenti Non Fit Injuria has not been now accepted as the universal Rule of Law and the Courts have found it necessary to make it subject to numerous exceptions depending upon the facts of each case involving various facts of justice in common law.  Probably in tune with the said development, the instant statute has carved out exception to the exception and the latter exception provides that  (if) the vehicle is the one in which

passengers are carried for hire or reward, or

Passengers are carried by reason of or  in pursuance of a contract of employment,

the liability of the owner of the truck to insure the risk involved to such passengers would subsist and the exception to the general rule incorporated in sub-clause (ii)  of clause (b) to S. 95 (1) would not apply to the rights of such passengers or to the liability incurred by the owner of the vehicle towards such passengers. 
  23. The question is as to whether when a hirer of the truck for transport of the goods is himself a passenger in the same he is being carried for reward or not.  Evidently, the word 'reward' in the instant provision connotes consideration.  No other meaning is capable of being ascribed to it.  A paraphrase of the said proviso clause (ii) can be that if the passenger is being carried for some consideration being received by the owner of the truck, such owner is under a statutory obligation to insure against the risk involved to such passenger. 
  24. The next question then arises is as to whether it could  be ever held that the hirer of a truck for carriage of his goods can even contend that he was being taken as a passenger for some ""consideration"".  Prima facie, our view was that there should be no legal impediments in coming to the conclusion that he was such a passenger, meaning thereby, a passenger who was being allowed by the owner of the truck to travel as a passenger of the truck as against the  consideration received by the owner of the truck.  After hearing fully Shri Chaphekar against this view, we are of the opinion that this prima facie view taken by us stands fully confirmed.  We found nothing in the arguments made by him which could persuade us to take a different view. 
  25. The question is of quite some importance and some detailed discussion relating to the rationale of the said question would not be out of place. 
  26. When the owner of the goods hires a vehicle for transportation of his goods, it becomes necessary for him that along with the goods the vehicle should carry some persons for : 
  27. He may do so by engaging special employees for the above purposes; he may do so by accompanying the vehicle himself along with some of its employees; he may do so by accompanying the vehicle all by himself.  From the very nature of things, the question as to which of the courses would be followed by him would depend upon various factors including his own financial and social position.  A Managing Director of a big Company hiring a vehicle for transportation of is goods will not be expected to accompany the employees for supervision over loading or unloading.  A transporter who is a small fry may not have sufficient manual  assistance for doing the job and hence he may be required to go all by himself with the goods.  Naturally he will be one of the passengers of the vehicle.  This is so to say, a phenomenon of common knowledge.  What is contemplated by Cl.  (ii) of the proviso is that a person going on a joy-ride on a motor vehicle cannot make a claim about the fact that the driver of the vehicle was negligent.  To this extent, the maxim Volenti  Non Fit Injuria is recognised by the statute.  But once the owner of the truck or his agent lawfully expects consideration from his passenger, the application of the said maxim ceases.  The passenger is no longer going on his frolics : he is no longer going for a joy-ride.  There comes into existence the business relation between the two and no person carrying another for consideration can contend that he can be negligent, vis-a-vis the passenger, with impunity.  That is the precise reason why the statute contemplates that once the passenger is being carried for consideration, there should be a liability of the carrier towards the passenger under the law of torts and it is this liability which is sought to be covered by said Section 95 (1) by grafting an exception to the exception found in Clause (ii) of the proviso.  Normally speaking, therefore, an analysis of the statutory provision should not lead one to the conclusion that a hirer of a vehicle who is a passenger in the vehicle should not be entitled to have the risk to himself covered by the insurance policy. 
  28. But certain authorities have taken contrary view and those were the authorities relied upon by the Tribunal.  Those authorities have taken the view that only the employees of the view that only the employees of the hirer who are the passengers on the vehicle at the relevant time would be entitled to the coverage of the insurance policy and not by the hirer himself.  We will examine the said authorities, but before examining the authorities it would be worthwhile examining the answers sought to be given by Mr.  Chaphekar, the learned Advocate for respondent 4 to the above mentioned analysis of said Section 95 (1).  He wanted to answer the said analysis and the conclusion arising out of the said analysis by reference to Clause 9b) to the proviso in the first instance and by reference to Rule 118, Motor Vehicles Rules in the second instance. 
  29. As regards said Clause (ii) to the proviso, his contention was  that the hirer, the claimant in the instant case, who was travelling along with the vehicle was not being carried by the owner of the vehicle (respondent 2 in the instant case) for reward at all.  His contention was firstly on the basis of the evidence obtaining in the instant case and secondly with reference to the general principles of law.  With reference to the evidence on record, Mr. Chaphekar contended that there is no  evidence in this case to show that any separate consideration was ear-marked or received by either respondent 2 or by his driver from the claimant for allowing him to be carried in the vehicle along with the goods.  In the first place, he pointed out that when the accident took place, the vehicle was not carrying the goods belonging to the claimant at all.  The factual position is that the claimant was going to some place at Thana on the Bombay-Agra Road for bringing his goods at Thana.  The goods were to be loaded at Thana.  They were to be brought back to Bombay and presumably were to be unloaded at Bombay.  He contends that there was no necessity for the claimant of  the goods to accompany the vehicle to reach the place where the goods were lying.  Secondly, even if he was accompanying the goods, the contract could be for the carriage of goods, not for the carriage of the owner of the goods.  The consideration that the owner of the goods was paying to the owner of the truck was for the carriage of the goods.  The contention was that in any event there was no evidence in the present case to show that any separate consideration was ear-marked  for the owner of the goods transported in the vehicle concerned.  If this is the position, the claimant could not be said to have satisfied the requirement of being a passenger  who was being carried for reward.  It is common ground before us that the words ""vehicle in which passengers are carried for reward"" are the relevant words.  The contention was that there was no evidence in the instant case to show that the claimant who was hiring the vehicle at the relevant time was being carried for reward or for consideration.  This being the position, the exception to the exception did not come into play, but only the exception remains.  If the exception remains, the application of the general rule contained in Cl.  (b)  (I)  to Sec.  95  (1) is ruled out and hence the general rule in Clause (ii) of said Section 95 (1) did not come into operation at all. 
  30. The above submission was with reference to the evidence on record:  The submission with reference to the general principles of law was that when a vehicle is hired for transport of goods, there need be no term of carrying the hirer or his employees along with the goods.  If, therefore, the hirer does travel along with the goods, his travel must be held to be without consideration unless it is specifically proved.  In other words, the submission was twofold :- 
  31. What must be proved is the additional consideration for transport of the hirer. 
  32. Carriage of the hirer incidentally with the goods cannot be taken as an implied term of the contract of carriage of the goods. 
  33. Prima someone should accompany the goods and go in the vehicle as a passenger along with the goods.  Likewise, it be comes necessary that someone should go as passenger in the first instnce for bringing the goods from some place and carrying them to some other place. This may be for loading or unloading of the goods or for many other purposes incidental to the transportation of the goods .  For instance, owner of the goods 'X' may bhaving his office in Bombay.  He wants his goods to be transported.  The goods may be lying in Thana,  He would engage a truck in Bombay, but for loading the goods from Thana he would require some employees.  He was employes in his office at BomBay Naturally , he would take those employees to Thana.  The goods would be loaded in the truck by the emokitees and the goods would be brought back to Bombay.  While coming back, naturaly the employees would accompany the goods as passengers.  In the truck.  Their coming back would be necessary so that the goods may be unloaded in Bombay.  When the owner of the goods enters into the contract of the carriage of goods in this manner the contract is of a composite character.  The contract is not for carriage of the goods; the contract is for safe and convenient transport the goods from the beginning till the the end and the process of contract involves loading and unloading and safe carriage.  For all this purpose, the accompniment of some other persons, other thatn the driever of the vehicle, along with the vehicle is imperative.  This is a matter of common knowledge and of everyday life.  Elaborate evidence is unnecessary for such conclusioin.  The doctrine of judicial notice looks after the evidental requirement for such judical conclusion.  The point is that the consideration which is paid by theowner of the goods for the transport of the goods is a composite consideration.  It is a consideration for the transport of goods as well as for the incidental transport of the passengers accompanying. The goods or those going for fetching the goods.  If this is so,, then the owner of the goods can legitimately contend that though he was having his office in bombay, he was going to thana for bringing his own goods and he entered into a contract with the owner of the truck by agreeing to pay the composite consideration; consideration for carriage of the goods and consideation for carriage mof the passenger necessary for supervision etc., of the goods. He can further legitiomately contend that if his employees could be legitimate passengers of the vehicle for supervising the transport of the goods.  He himself could as wel be a passenger whose presence on the vehicle at the relevant time is as much necessary and as much part of a contract for which he paid the consideration.  Once it is accepted that the consideration paid by him included the consideration for his own carriage, it cannot be said that he was not carried by the driver of the truck for reward at the relevant time. 
  34. The plea that the claimant was not accompanying the goods and hence must be deemed to be one not being carried for reward need not detain us long.  The plea is in fact answered by the above analytical discussion.  When a vehicle is hired for bringing goods from a place away from the place of office or residence of the hirer, as also of the owner of the vehicle, it is natural that the hirer and or his employees will, quite ofte, go by the vehicle.to the place where the relevant goods are lying. Their transport to that place is as much a part of the contract and, hence , for ""reward"" or consideration. 
  35. The plea that for carriage of the hirer along ith the goods or for fetching the goods must be backed by special or additional consideration and that his carriage cannot be read as an implied term of all such contracts is unacceptable for the same reasons as mentioned above.  The consideration is normally a composite consideration.  Moreover, the carriage of the hirer or his employees along with the goods or for fetching the goods is essentially an incidental part of the contract of carriage; for such incicdental servces.  No special consideration is expected.  That incidental services .  no special consideration is expecged.  That incidental services is an implied term of the contract, for instance a passenger in an omnibus can carry with him a small brief-case.  For carrying that brief -case no special or addititonal ticket is necessary. But that does not mean that no consideration is paid.  The price already paid for the ticket is itself the consideration. 
  36. To our mind, the above analysis answers bothe the submissions; 'the sub-mission based on the evidence on record as well as the submission based upon the general law'.  We do not think that there exists any necessity for any special evidence on record for any special evidence on record for coming at the above mentioned conclusion. 
  37. Mr. Chaphekar further posed a question to himself and he would like the Court to consider it. Question was: If the owner of the truck stated to the owner of the goods that he would not allow anybody to accompany the goods in the truck.  If such a condititon was put by the owner, would it not be a valid condition?  A simple answer to this question is that it might be perfectly open for the owner of the goods either to accept that condition or not to engage him as a the very fact that the owner of the truck carrier of the goods.  But the point is that allowed the owner of the goods to go with the vehicle as a passenger in the truck means that there was no such condition put by the owner of the truck.  The very fact that the owner of the goods was allowed to be carried by the owner of the truck serves as the evidence to the contrary of the  fact that he allowed the owner of the goods to travel as a passenger of the truck and this permission was a part and parcel of the entire contract of carriage . 
  38. The analysis of said Calause (b) to the proviso sought to be made by Mr.Chaphekar cannot, therefore, be accepted by us. 
  39. The next ground on which Mr. Chaphekar wanted us to read said Clause (b) of the proviso otherwise is based upon the provisions of Rule118, Motor vehicles Rules.  The relevant portion of said Rule 118 is caluse (1) of the same which runs as follows:- 
  There is no dispute that truck 'A' answered to this description and hence it was a goods vehicle.  But the construction sought to be put by mr. Chaphekar upon Rule 118 is difficult ot be accepted.  Said Rs. 118allows the carriage of passengers of goods vehicle in certain circumstances but, that does not mean that there is any prohibition against the hiere for goods vehicle from travelling in said goods vehicle by virtue of anything contained in said Rule 118,  In the first place, the persons who are to be carried free of charge, as per the said Rule, are the only bona fide employees of the owner or the hirer of the vehicle. The words 'Carried free of charge"" do not apply to or describe the owner or hirer of the vehicle.  Theyapply to or describe only the employees of the said owner or hirer.  If this was not so and if it was sought to be contended that they apply to the hirer as well, by the same logic and reasoning it could be said to apply to the owner as well. But is should be meaningles to contend that the owner should be carried on the vehicle free of charge. The owner could not be expected to charge anything to himself.  In other words, as per the said Rule 118, the following persons can travel by a goods vehicle:  
40.  Some arguments were advanced relating to the words ""free of charge"".  The contention was that if a person was to be carried free of charge. Then it could not be said that they were carried for reward under clause (ii) of the provisio to Section 95 (1) To our mind, this is a confused reasonint.  In the first place, Rule 118 could not have an overridding  effect over the section for the very simple reason that the Rule cannot have dominance over the Rule cannot have dominance over the Act.  Moreover , the Rule is a regional provision whereas the Act is of all India application.  But more important than the above considerations is the fact that there exists no conflict whatsoever between Rs.118 and Clause (b) of proviso to Section 95  (1) Under the said clause (b) to the proviso, the persons to be carried for hire or reward are the passengers other than the employees concerned.  The employees may be the employees of the owner or the hirer.  The employees need not be carried for reward.""    The words ""carried for reward"" apply to the passengers other than the employees .  This is clear from the fact that the words ""passengers carried for hire or reward"" are used in contradistinction with the words""by reason of contract of employment"". Moreover, we are of the view that the word ""reward"" used in clause (b) of the proviso to the section has a distinctly separte connotation from the  words ""free of charge"" in Rule 118.  The rewqrd that is paid within the contemplation of the proviso to the section is the reward by the owner of the goods to the ownerof the goods to the woner of the vehicle.  The charge contemplated by Rule 118 is by the owner or hirer of the vhicle to his own employees. In other words , if the owner or the hirer charges any consideration even to his own employees for being carried by the goods truck, such carriage is not permitted by rule 118.  In order that the hirer or the owner of the goods vehicle canb allow his bona fide employees to travel by the vehicle.  It is imperative that they should not be required to pay any special charge at all for the said carriage. 
41.  To our mind, this is perfectly in keeping with the general tenor of the law.  A goods vehicle is essentially meant for carriage of the goods.  As mentioned above, along with the goods vehicle passengers sometime are required to be transported for the purpose of, say, loading or unloading of the goods.  From the very nature of thethings., the owner or the hirer of the truck cannot tell such employees that they should pay charges for their conveyance.  The goods vehicle is not intended for earning monies by transportation of human beings on the goods vehicle.  The goods vehicle is engaged essentially for transportation of goods and goods only and the employees are transported along with it because the transportation of the goods itself would be rendered difficult if such employees do not accompany the goods.  In other words, the transportation of the employees in incidental.  It can be only without consideration and that is the reason why we find that unless the employees in incidental. It can be only without consideration and that is the reason why we find that unless the employees are carried in such goods vehicle free of charge, it would bot be a goods vehicle.  If the employees are charged for transportation by goods vehicle, it would cease to be a goods vehicle, it would cease to be a goods vehicle .  It would become a public service vehicle within the meaning of the Act.  The said term ""public service vehicle"" is defined in Sect. 2 (25) of the Act as follows: 
42.  If any amount is to be charged to the passengers in any vehicle, then such vehicle must be adapted for carriage of passengers.  Passengers can be carried for hire or reward only by a public service vehicle and not by a goods vehicle.  This is all that said Rule 118 contemplates.  It is wrong to find any conflict between said Rule 118 and  said proviso (b) (ii) to Section 95of the Act. 
  43. 15A This brings us to the authorities which are relied upon by both the learned advocates in support of their respective contentions.  It must be stated here that the view taken by the tribunal does find support from certain authorities.  However, there are other authorities which have taken the contrary view which supports the view which we have taken in this case. 
  44. The first authority that needs to be examined is the judgment of theDivision Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the case of the Gujarat High court in the case of Sakinabibi, (1947) 15 Guj LR 428) .  This authority had given rise to certain controversies as a result of which some of the questions considered by the said authority were required to be re-examined by a Full Bench of the Gujarat High court subsequently to which we will presently, refer.  The fact of the above mentioned gujarat authority were as follows:- 
45.  These arguments were repelled by the gujarat High court. 
  46. We do not propose to refer to the elaborate reasoning of the said Court while arriving at the conclusion, because this judgment has been toned down by the subsequent judgment of the Supreme court and hence the law has been restated in that perspective by a subsequent full Bench judtgment of the Gujarat High court and secondly because the question with which we are concerned did not directly arise in that case.  In our case, there is no contention that the insurance cover would not extend to any passenger of a goods vehicle whatsoever.  The limited ontention in our case is as to whether the owner of the goods who has hired the truck and who is apassenger on the truck is covered by the insurance policy given by the Insurance company or not / 

 

  47. After this judgment came the decision of the Supereme court in the case of Pushpabai Parshottam Udeshi Y. Ranjit ginning & Pressing co . Pvt Ltd.  .  In the said case, the Manager of the respondent company was driving the car belonging to the company.  He gave lift to deceased Udeshi and while the car was being driven by him it ment with an accident owing to the negligence of the said driver-Manager.  The Insurance company with whome the car was insured repudiated its liability under the policy contending that deceased Udeshi was not being carried in the car for hire or reward.  After construing clause (ii) of the proviso to section 95 (1).  The Supremen Court observed as follows (at p. 1746):- 
48.  This reference was considered by the Full bench of the Gujarat High court and is , Ambaben v. Usmanbhai Amirmiya Shejkh.  After examining the vasrious authorities as also the judgment of the supreme Court as also the previous view of theGujarat High Court in Sakinabibi's ease, the full Bench answered the reference as follows (at p. 14) 

  ""The decision in Sakinabibi's case, (1974) 15 Guj LR 428, is toned down to the extent we have indicated in our judgment above, by the decision of the Supreme Court inPushpabai's case,  and in the light of that decision, it is obvious that so far as the policy contemplated by Section 95 (1)  (b) is concened , it does not cover the risks to (A persons other than those who were carried for hire or rewrd at the time of occurrence of event which gives rise to the claim against the insurer and (B) passengers other than those who were bona fide employees of the owner or hirer of the vehicle not exceeding six in number , carried in pursuance of or by reason of a contract of employment. 
  49. Considerable reliance was palaced upon this full Bench Judgment on behalf of the respondents in this Court as well as before the tribunal.  The Tribunal was of the view that according to the Gujarat Full Bench the hirer of the truck who is the passenger in the goods vehicle hired by him for carriage of goods does fall in the exception to the main rule contained in Section 95 (1) (b)  (I) and does not fall in the exception to the exception.  In other words the view of the Tribunal appears to be that according to the Gujarat full Bench's view such woner of the goods who is a passenger of the truck hired by him is not ""any person"" contemplated by clause  (I) of Section 95 (1) (b) but he belongs to the category of persons who are excepted from the operation of said clause (I) of Section 95 (I) (b) of the Act. 
  50. We have examined the said authorities fully and we are of the view that the explanation sought to be given to the said  Full Bench authority by the Tribunal is not justified at all.  To our mind, the view taken by the Full Bench of the Gujarat High Court, with  great respect, fully supports the view which we have Full supports the view which we have taken above.  To our mind, all that the Full Bench has done is that it has found the earlier Division Bench ruling of the Gujarat High Court to be of a too very broad and sweeping character.  By virtue of the said view, every passenger in the goods vehicle was likely to be covered by the insurance risk and if that was the position, then the exception clause contained in clause (b) of the proviso to Section 95 (1) would be rendered meaningless.  That view of the Gujarat High Court was certainly at variance with or in conflict with the view expressed by the Supreme Court in the above mentioned Pushpabai's case .  But the Gujarat Full Bench has not gone to the extent of stating that in no case a hirer of the goods vehicle for transport of his own goods vehicle for transport of his own goods vehicle for transport of his own goods would be covered by the insurance policy required to be taken by said  Section 95.  The Full Bench takes the view that certain categories of passengers travelling in the goods vehicle would be required to be covered by the insurance policy, whereas the other category of passengers need not be covered.  The Full Bench gives a clear indication of the fact that if the passenger in a goods vehicle was being carried for hire or reward, then such passenger in a goods vehicle was being carried for hire or reward, then such passenger would be required to be covered by the insurance policy, whereas the other category of passengers need not be covered.  The Full Bench gives a clear indication of the fact that if the passenger in a goods vehicle was being carried for hire or reward, then such passenger would be required to be covered by the insurance policy. 
  51. The question, however, remains as to whether a person who has hired a goods vehicle for transport of his goods and who is also a passenger on the vehicle can be said to be travelling by the vehicle for hire or reward or not.  This question did not directly arise for the consideration of the Full Bench of the Gujarat High Court because the  Full Bench was  deciding an abstract question referred to it by the Division Bench not with reference to the facts of the particular case but with reference to the provisions of law with particular reference to the provision of the Motor Vehicles Act in the context of the above mentioned Supreme Corut's judgment in Pushpabai's case .  We are unable to see anything in the Full Bench decision which supports the view that the risk involved to the owner of the goods who has hired the vehicle for transport of his goods and who is a passenger on the vehicle at the time of the said transport is never required  to be taken by the owner of the goods vehicle in question.  But a direct authority in support of the proposition which we have expounded above is to be found in the judgment of the Karnataka High Court in the case of Channappa Chanavirappa Katti v.  Laxman Bhimappa Bajantri,  .  The relevant facts in the case with which the Karnataka High Court was concerned were practically identical with the facts in the present case.  Deceased Somappa Mallapa had hired a truck which was a goods had hired  a truck which was a goods vehicle for carriage of his goods and while the goods were being carried, he was one of the passenngers in the truck.  On account of the negligence of the driver of the truck it met with an accident in which deceased Somappa Mallappa died.  Negligence of the driver having been proved and vicarious liability of the owner of the truck also being proved, question arose as to whether the owner of the truck owed any liability to the owner of the goods who was the hirer of the truck and who was the passenger in the truck at the relevant time which truck was carrying the goods at the same time.  The Karnataka High Court held that Section 95 of the Act made it compulsory for the owner to cover the risk for such liability to such passenger-hirer.  In this connection, the Karnataka HIgh Court observation, the Karnataka High Court observed in para 17 of its judgment as follows.
  52. With respect, we ae in complete agreement with the above analysis and reasoning of the learned Judges of the Karnataka High Court. 
  53. The proposition expounded by us above finds support, to some extent, also  from the judgment of the Andra Pradesh High Court in the case of Meesala Suryanarayana v.  Goli atuavathi (1979 Acc CJ 513).  In that case also the owner of the goods who had hired the goods vehicle in question and who was the passenger in the goods vehicle at the time when his goods were being carried met with an accident on account of the negligent driving of the driver of the truck as a result of which he died.  Unfortunately, in that case the insurance policy was not produced by the Insurance Company who sought to repudiate its liability and a general contention was raised that the liability of the owner of the goods vehicle towards the hirer of the goods vehicle when the hirer was personally travelling in the truck for transport of his goods vehicle towards the hirer of the goods vehicle when the hirer was personally traveling in the truck for transport of his goods was not compulsorily required to be insured against.  This contention was negatived by the Division Bench of the High Court.  While discussing this question the Court referred to the judgment of the Madras High Court in the case Vanguard Insurance Co.  v.  Chinnammal   with particular reference to the following passage of the judgment given by Alagiriswami J., which is as follows (at p. 237);-
  54. Relying upon  the above observation, the  Andhra Pradesh High Court  observed is Para 20 of its judgmetnt as follows:-   
  55. It will be thus seen that the principle that the Andhra Pradesh High  Court and  the Madras High Court  located  in this connection is the  principle of practical or business reasons.  The owner of the goods was travelling in the goods vehicle not for any fun or for a joy-ride.  He was travelling for the business purpose.  This principle of business purpose is evolved out of the underlying principle of the proviso to Section 95 (1) indicated by the words ""for hire or reward"". 
  56. With respect, we  are in complete agreement with this view of the matter.  
  57.  It is true that the Andhra Pradesh High Court  in the above mentioned Meesala Suryanarayana's case (1979 Acc CJ 513)  arrived at the above mentioned conclusion aiso by virtue of the fact that the policy of insurance was not produced before the Court and hence the Court proceeded to take the view that the policy contained no prohibition against the carrying of such passengers as the owner of the goods.  In this view of the matter, it was probably not necessary for the Court to consider as to whether it was open for the Insurance Company to exclude its liability to wards such passenger. But we are satisfied that having regard to the observation in para 20 of the said judgment which is extracted  above, the High Court was of the view   that there existed a statutory liability upon the owner of the  goods vehicle to insure his own liability towards the hirer of the truck for goods transport when the hirer is himself one of the passengers on the truck with the consent of the owner of the truck or his agent. 
  58. There were other authorities which were also sought to be relied upon.  But it is unnecessary to refer to all of them. 
 59. We may now refer to the authorities which have been relied upon by the tribunal.  The main authority is the judgment of a learned single Judge of the High Court of  Punjab and Haryana in the case of Oriental    Fire &  General Insurance Co.  Ltd.  v.  Kasturi Lal,  (1968 Acc CJ 227).  In that case, the deceased, one Shamlal was carrying wheat   belonging to M/s.  Roshan Lal Kasturi Lal  in the goods vehicle  which  the said firm had hired for transport of the said wheat.  The deceased was one of the partners of the firm.  While the  firm.  While the truck was being driven, it met with an accident on account of the negligence of the driver of the truck in which accident Sham  Lal died.  His  father Kasturi Lal filed an application, making claim under Section 110 of the Act for compensation on account of the negligence   of the driver of the truck.  The claim was made against not only the driver and the owner of the truck but also against the Insurance Co., which had insured the said truck as required by Section 95 of the Act.  The negligence of the driver was held proved and hence the liability of the owner of the truck also could not be denied.  But the question arose as to whether such liability was covered by the Insurance policy taken by the owner of the truck from the Insurance Company.  The Company contended that it owed no liability under the policy, inter alia, because deceased Sham Lal was not being carried in the truck for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment. In this connection the judgment of the same High Court in the case of Oriental Fire and General Insurance  Co.  Ltd v. Smt. Gurdev Kaur,  was relied upon.  The reply to this contention, on behalf of the claimant, was that the deceased Sham Lal was in the employment of M/s.  Roshan  Lal Kasturi Lal when their goods were being carried on hire in the truck to Delhi.  This contention of the claimant was negatived by the Punjab High Court and the Court held that the deceased was not not an employee of the hirer firm at all.  The learned single Judge, therefore, relied upon the above mentioned earlier Full Bench Judge, therefore relied upon the above mentioned earlier Full Bench judgment of the same High Court reported in 1967  Acc CJ 158.  In that case, the Full Bench judgment of the sme High Court reported in 1967 Acc CJ 158.  In that case, the Full Bench had taken the view that the hirer of a goods vehicle, when he is travelling as a passenger in the  vehicle carried for hire or reward nor is he a passenger who is being carried in the said vehicle by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment.  Taking this view of the matter the Punjab High Court upheld the contention of the Insurance did not cover the liability of the owner of goods vehicle towards the hirer of the same while the  latter was travelling by the vehicle.
 60. With great respect, we are unable to agree with the above reasoning.  We are unable to agree with the above reasoning.  We have examined the earlier Full Bench decision of the Punjab High Court.  To our mind, the learned  Judges addressed themselves more to the question as to whether the passenger in the goods vehicle was required to be in the employment of hirer or owner of the vehicle or not.  We do not find that the Court addressed itself to the question as to whether, in given circumstances,"" the hirer of the goods vehicle could be said to be travelling by the ""practical or business reasons"" on the basis of which the words 'for hire or reward"" in the said proviso to Section 95 (1) are construed does not appear to have been urged before the Full Bench of the Punjab High Court at all not does it seem to have been urged before the learned single Judge of the same Court in the subsequent case of Oriental Fire & General Insurance Co.  Ltd.  v.  Kasturi lal,  (1968  Acc.  C.  J.  227) which we have referred to above.  To our mind, the fact that the hirer of the goods vehicle who is the owner of the goods carried by the vehicle and who is a passenger of the vehicle at the time of the carriage, does not answer the description of being an employee either of the owner or hirer of the truck does not mean that he does not fall in the other category of passengers who are required to be covered by the insurance.
 61. The above authority of the Punjab High Court in Kasturilal's case was followed by the Madras High Court in the case of Commonwealth Assurance Co.  Ltd.  Bombay v.  V.P. Rahim Khan Sahib, .  The Court held that a owner of the goods accompanying the goods in a truck cannot be said to be travelling in the truck by virtue of any contract of emplovment.  But as we see, even before the Madras High Court the point that the owner of the goods accompanying the goods in the truck hired by him answered the description of the passenger who was being carried for hire or reward was not urged before the learned single Judge.
  62. With great respect, therefore, we are unable to concur wwith the ultimate conclusion arrived at by the said Court. 
  63. We are of the view that the better view as between the two sets of authorities is the one to  which we have arrived upon the analysis of the statutory provisions.  We are of the view that when a hirer of a goods vehicle for carriage of his goods is travelling by the said vehicle in connection with the carriage of the goods with the consent of the driver or owner of the goods vehicle in question, he must be deemed to be a passenger on the vehicle for reward within the meaning of Clause (ii)  of the proviso to Section 95 (1) of the Act and hence the tortious liability of the owner towards him must be covered by the insurance policy contemplated by the said section.   
  64. We are of the view that the view of the Gujarat High Court and Karnataka High Court on this point is in consonance and in keeping with the provisions of the statute.  We do not agree with the view expressed by the Tribunal that the earlier view expressed by the Tribunal that the earlier view expressed by the Gujarat High Court in (1974)  15  Guj LR 426 (Sakinabibi's case) is overruled by the Full Bench of the Gujarat High Court.  The fact that it is toned down does not mean that its view is completely overruled.  To our mind, the essential part of the earlier Gujarat decision still holds good and it is the correct exposition of law. 
  65. Having this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed.  We hold that the claimant is entitled  to an additional amount of Rs.  7,200/- from respondent 2.  In view of the fact that the Tribunal had held the liability of respondent 2 to be extending to Rs.  32,800/- only and in view of the fact that according to us he was entitled to a sum of Rs. 7,200/- the total amount he becomes entitled from respondent 2 is Rs.  40,000/-.  We are also of the view that the claimant is entitled to recover the said amount from respondent 4 also and hence the decree can be executed against respondent 4 as well.  It is however, made clear that the liability of respondents 2 and 4 shall be joint and several.  So far as respondents  1 and 3 are concerned, the appeal against them fails and it stands dismissed so far as they are concerned.  Respondents 2 and 4 shall pay the cost of this appeal to the appellant. The decretal amount shall pay the cost of this appeal to the appellant.  The decretal amount shall carry interest at the rate of 6% p. a. from the date of the application till the date of satisfaction. 
  66.                          Appeal allowed.

need not, therefore, recapitulate the same all over again except to the

extent it is necessary. Shorn of details, the prosecution case as reflected in

the charge-sheet is as under :
4.           In a macabre incident which took place on 20.03.1975 at

about 04.15 P.M. the assailants threw two hand-grenades in the car in an

attempt to murder Sh.A.N.Ray, the then Chief Justice of India (in short :

Instead of giving reply / response, the assailant suddenly started running

towards Bhagwan Dass Road. It prompted Jai Nand to get out of the car

and chase the assailant shouting „pakro - pakro‟. The culprit entered into a

taxi parked nearby at Bhagwan Dass Road; came out of it immediately;

fled towards Garhwal House; jumped over it; crossed its front gate and

disappeared. SI Om Prakash, PW- Const.Jai Lal, PW-Ramji Lal and many

others joined PW-Jai Nand to chase the assailant but in vain.

              The police machinery swung into action promptly on getting

information from Police Control Room. Insp.Sajjan Singh, SHO Tilak

Marg Police Station along with his team of police personnel reached the

spot after receiving the wireless message from SI Inder Singh. He made

an unsuccessful search for the culprit and returned to the crime scene at

about 05.10 P.M. He examined the spot of occurrence, prepared a rough

sketch (Ex.P-106) of the crime scene and seized various articles. He

lodged First Information Report after recording Jai Nand‟s statement

(Ex.P16). Two unexploded hand-grenades (Ex.A3 and Ex.A4) lying near

the rear portion of the car, handkerchiefs (Ex.A5 and Ex.A6) were taken

into possession. Services of Major S.K.Sharma, Garrison Engineer were

requisitioned to defuse the hand-grenades. Statements of the witnesses

conversant with the facts were recorded. On 21.03.1975, the investigation

was transferred to Crime Branch, Delhi Police. One Abrol arrested as a

suspect was subsequently got discharged for want of evidence.

5.           The assailants without indicating their identity claimed

responsibility for the attack and conveyed the information to various

newspapers. „The Indian Express‟ published a news-item developed out of

a communication Ex.P10 received from „unknown sources‟ on

24.03.1975. Similar communication (Ex.P11) was received in the office of
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 5 of 201
 „The Statesman‟. PW-16 (Prakasha Rao), Deputy News Editor sent it to

the police as it contained dangerous matter. Communications Ex.P12 &

Ex.P13 were dispatched to „The Hindustan Samachar‟ and „The Hindustan

Times‟. Letter (Ex.P14) contained in an envelope (Ex.P14/A), addressed

to CJI was received by his Private Secretary in between March 23 and 30,

1975 when he was on tour to Punjab. Sh.S.K.Gupta, Registrar, Supreme

Court, received it on April 01 or 02, 1975 after return from Punjab and he

forwarded it to Superintendent of Police (Security).

6.           It is relevant to note that CBI had earlier registered RC1/75-

CIA-1/SPE under Section 120B IPC; 302 IPC and Sections 3 & 4 of the

Explosive Substances Act, 1908 pertaining to Sh.L.N.Misra murder in a

bomb-blast at Samastipur in Bihar. A-1 had already been arrested in the

said proceedings in Patna on June 17, 1975. Feeling nexus between

L.N.Misra murder case and the present one, Delhi Administration made a

request to Delhi Special Police Establishment for investigation in the

present case as well. CBI thereon formally registered the present case as

RC11/75(CIU)/SPE/CBI dated June 30, 1975 at 05.40 P.M. and the

investigation was assigned to Sardari Lal, DSP, CIU.

7.           A-1 was formally arrested in this case on June 30, 1975 at

08.30 P.M. Pursuant to disclosures made by him during police remand, A-
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 6 of 201
 2 was arrested on 06.07.1975 and various articles including three diaries

(Ex.P123, Ex.P124 and Ex.P125) were recovered from his residence.

Vikram and A-3 were arrested at Bhagalpur on July 24, 1975 in some

other case. They were formally arrested in the instant case on July 27, and

brought to Delhi by air on July 28, 1975. A-1 to A-3 declined to

participate in Test Identification Parade (in brief : TIP) fixed for July 30.

Vikram during police remand from July 31 to August 14, 1975, expressed

desire to record confessional statement (Ex.P9) voluntarily on August 14,

1975 before Sh.R.D.Aggarwal (PW-20), Addl. Chief Metropolitan

Magistrate. Vikram was granted conditional pardon by Chief Metropolitan

Magistrate and was made an approver on August 22, 1975.

8.           During further investigation, CBI arrested Ram Nagina

Prasad at Icchapur on July 18, 1975 in L.N.Misra murder case. On July

25, 1975, pursuant to disclosure statement (Ex.P142) at his instance hand-

grenade (Ex.A9) was recovered from near the bamboo wall of meat shop

of Jagdish at Icchapur.
9.           During extensive and marathon investigation, CBI recorded

statements of number of witnesses conversant with the facts. Anonymous

letters (Ex.P10 to Ex.P14) were collected. From the approver‟s

disclosures, CBI came to know about the activities of the conspirators in
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 7 of 201
 relation to the object and scheme of the conspiracy and the manner in

which the object of the conspiracy was sought to be achieved and

executed. On A-1‟s interrogation, CBI came to know about his association

with PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) doing Ph.D. in Indian Agricultural Research

Institute, Delhi. On July 05, 1975, DSP B.R.Puri (PW-71) recovered guest

register (Ex.P122) containing entry (Ex.PW-122/A) relating to reservation

of accommodation in the hostel for two days i.e. March 20 & 21, 1975 by

him for a guest „Pawan Kumar of Azamgarh‟. It revealed that the said

reservation was made at A-1‟s instance and the accommodation was used

by him to stay with A-3. On A-2‟s interrogation, it came to light that he

had booked a berth in second class on March 15, 1975 in the name of

„Pankaj Kumar‟ to perform journey from Delhi to Howrah by a train

departing Delhi on March 25, 1975 at the instance of A-1. A-1 allegedly

asked A-2 on March 21, 1975 for another reservation in the said train in

the name of „Ramesh Kumar‟. After recording statements of the relevant

witnesses and scanning relevant railway documents, it revealed that A-1

and A-3 had performed the journey on the tickets reserved in fictitious

names by A-2. The investigating agency discovered on A-1‟s

interrogation that Tilak Raj Bhatia (PW-4) and Charan Singh (PW-5) had

knowledge about the movements of A-1 and his associates at the time of
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 8 of 201
 commission of the crime. In their statements recorded on July 10, 1975,

PW-4 and PW-5 confirmed the account of the occurrence later on given

by the approver.
10.          During further investigation, the exhibits were sent to Central

Forensic Science Laboratory for examination and its reports were

collected. Specimen handwriting and signatures of the appellants were

obtained and sent for comparison with the questioned documents. The

Chief Investigating Officer obtained the required sanction (Ex.P-153)

from the Administrator of Union Territory of Delhi for the prosecution of

A-1, A-3 and Ram Nagina Prasad under Sections 4 & 6, Explosive

Substances Act, 1908. On completion of investigation, CBI submitted the

final report to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on August 28, 1975. The

learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate recorded the statement of Vikram,

the approver, on various dates between December 03, 1975 and January

14, 1976 and committed the case to the Court of Sessions by an order

dated January 23, 1976.
11.          After hearing both the sides and considering the record of the

case, the Trial Court did not find sufficient ground to proceed against Ram

Nagina Prasad for the offence of criminal conspiracy to kill CJI. For the

reasons given in the order dated 14.05.1976, Ram Nagina Prasad was
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 9 of 201
 exonerated of the charge under Section 120B IPC. He was charged-

sheeted for committing offences under Sections 4(b) & 6, Explosive

Substances Act. Joint charges under Section 120B IPC were framed

against the appellants. A-1 and A-3 in addition were charged for

committing offence under Section 307 IPC and 4(b) Explosive Substances

Act. The appellants abjured their guilt and claimed trial. The prosecution

examined 85 witnesses in all on various dates. Statements of the

appellants were recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. The Trial Court

undertook a very elaborated exercise by putting almost 171 questions to

the appellants with respect to the evidence brought on record and the

circumstance appearing against them to give an opportunity to explain.

The appellants denied their complicity in the crime and pleaded false

implication. Plea of alibi was set up by A-1 & A-3. The defence examined

eight witnesses and relied upon documents (Ex.D1 to Ex.D67).

12.          The Trial Court examined the grievances raised by the

appellants elaborately. After appreciating the evidence and considering

the rival contentions of the parties, the Trial Court by the impugned

detailed judgment acquitted Ram Nagina Prasad of the charge and

convicted the appellants for the offences described previously. Being


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 10 of 201
 aggrieved and dissatisfied, they have preferred the appeals. It is pertinent

to note that State did not challenge Ram Nagina Prasad‟s acquittal.

(B)          Submissions / Arguments on behalf of the Appellants

13.          I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at great length

on various dates.
14.          Learned counsel for A-3 strenuously urged that the Trial

Court did not appreciate the evidence in its true and proper perspective.

He stressed that Vikram‟s statement cannot be read into evidence. He

informed    that    during      the   pendency   of   instant   appeals,    in

Crl.A.No.174/2012, „Sudevanand vs. State‟, 2012 (3) SCC 387, Supreme

Court by an order 19.01.2012 ordered to recall PW-Vikram for further

cross-examination. CBI, however, could not trace Vikram and expressed

inability to examine him. He further urged that under Articles 141, 142

and 144 of the Constitution of India, this Court was bound to follow the

order dated 19.01.2012 in letter and sprit. Besides this, the Supreme Court

doubted the truthfulness, honesty and reliability of the statement of

Vikram as he (PW-Vikram) had made two diametrically opposite

statements one before CBI (in the instant case) and other before CID in

Danapur Jail on 30.09.1978. Adopting an alternative argument, counsel

urged that even if approver‟s statement is taken into consideration, he is
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 11 of 201
 not a reliable and trustworthy witness and under Section 3 of the Evidence

Act, his statement cannot be read as part of evidence. Vikram knowingly

furnished false address, fake surety and dishonest undertaking not to leave

Delhi till trial in L.N.Misra case was over. The said trial is still continuing

and despite issuance of non-bailable warrants, he chose not to appear

before the Court. CBI was hand-in-glove with approver Vikram from the

beginning and was solely responsible for his abscondance. Learned

counsel further urged that statement of PW-1, approver Vikram, is beyond

the parameters of Section 306 Cr.P.C. An accomplice who needs pardon

from the trial of the offence must be involved in the crime and that his

acts must constitute wilfully taking part in the said crime. In the instant

case, PW-1 was not a willing party to the crime. He obeyed A-1 without

application of mind. His statement has not been corroborated in material

particulars by any independent witness. PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia), PW-44

(Rajbir Singh), PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) and PW-57 (Raj Singh) were

defectors from the „Organisation‟ and were themselves suspects. Their

role was not different from that of PW-Vikram. Their statements recorded

under Sections 161 and 164 Cr.P.C. were not voluntary as during

Emergency they were kept in detention for number of days and forced to


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                    Page 12 of 201
 give evidence as per CBI‟s dictates. They could not corroborate the

statement of PW-Vikram.
15.             Counsel further urged that the prosecution could not establish

if the appellants hatched „criminal conspiracy‟ to base conviction for the

offence under Section 120B IPC. Relying upon various judgments,

Counsel pointed out that acts subsequent to the achieving of the object of

conspiracy have to be ignored from the essential elements of conspiracy.

Any subsequent act which though unlawful, would not make the accused a

part of the conspiracy. If two views are possible, the one favourable to the

accused has to be adopted. He further emphasised that the prosecution is

required to stand on its own legs and cannot get any advantage from the

explanations given by the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. Mere false

explanation in answer to a question under Section 313 would not come

within the purview of additional link or circumstance against the accused

towards his guilt. He emphasised that mere membership of an

„Organisation‟ cannot incriminate a person unless he is proved to have

resorted to the acts of violence. In the instant case, Anand Marga, an

„association‟     or   „Organisation‟   (hereinafter   to   be   referred   as

„Organisation‟) was banned by Central Government after internal

Emergency in June, 1975. The appellants and Vikram were falsely
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                    Page 13 of 201
 implicated as they were members of the banned „Organisation‟ and were

allegedly associated together. A-3 was never a party to criminal

conspiracy for committing the murder of the CJI. There is no evidence if

A-3 had attended any meeting where any such conspiracy was discussed.

Statement made by approver cannot be taken as independent evidence and

is inadmissible under Section 10 of the Evidence Act.

16.          Counsel further argued that since the prosecution case was

based upon circumstantial evidence, it was legally required to prove each

and every fact or circumstance beyond reasonable doubt. The

circumstances so proved must form a chain where the inference is only of

the crime committed and that the evidence should be such which goes

only to prove that the alleged conspirators had committed the crime and

that there is no other hypothesis or theory sustainable except indicating

directly towards the guilt of the accused. The Counsel pointed out various

omissions in the statement of PW-57 (Raj Singh) whereby he did not

name A-3 to be the „individual‟ who stayed with PW-Vikram on the night

of 19.03.1975 at his house. There was no independent corroboration to

PW-57 (Raj Singh)‟s statement who remained in police custody from July

01 to July 09 and never went to the office during this period. Criticising

PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia)‟s testimony, he pointed out that he did not know
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 14 of 201
 A-3 but identified him after the police had shown him. Similarly, PW-5

(Charan Singh) did not know A-3. The Trial Court rightly observed that

A-3‟s refusal to participate in the TIP was justified and could not be used

against him. PW-30 (Ramesh Kumar Bagdi)‟s statement in the

identification of A-3 was not reliable. He categorically admitted that

requisition slip (Ex.P57) was shown to him in June, 1975 when in fact

such a slip was allegedly recovered by the police on 13.07.1975 from PW-

25 (Prem Prakash Sharma). He did not utter a word about A-3‟s presence

in the train with A-1. Evidence of Foot Print Expert, PW-38 (P.S.Nayyar),

was violative of Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. While in police

custody, A-3 was subjected to custodial violence and was forced to wear

chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2). That was an effort of CBI to make him a

witness against himself. Since the Trial Court did not believe A-3‟s

disclosure statement (Ex.P101), reliance on the statement of PW-53 (Shiv

Charan) regarding purchase of „hawai‟ chappals from his shop on

20.03.1975 was not permissible. CBI could not establish cogent evidence

regarding stay of A-3 in the hostel. PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) did not talk to

A-3 on any of the days including March 25.
17.          Counsel further urged that period of hatching of conspiracy

was described in the charge. Acts committed prior or after the said period
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 15 of 201
 of conspiracy are not within its ambit. The FIR talks only of „one

assailant‟ but CBI in complete disregard of the said FIR changed the

prosecution story during investigation. On the same set of evidence, Ram

Nagina Prasad was acquitted. Thus conviction of A-3 under Section 4 (b)

of the Explosive Substances Act was not acceptable. Counsel further

emphasised that investigation and trial were not fair, transparent and legal.

CBI started investigation on 30.06.1975 when internal Emergency had

already come into operation. It is unbelievable that CBI knew it on that

very day that A-1, A-3 and Vikram were involved in the aforesaid attack.

This fact was entertained by various CBI investigators especially PW-71

(B.R.Puri), DSP, CBI, who was already involved in the investigation of

various cases including Anand Murti‟s case and L.N.Misra murder case.

PW-71 was absolutely prejudiced against the workers of                   the

„Organisation‟ and influenced the Chief Investigating Officer to involve

the appellants in this case. The investigation was completely biased,

motivated and mala-fide.
18.          Counsel further urged that sentence order itself was illegal

under Section 31 Cr.P.C. which provides that maximum consecutive

sentence cannot exceed more than fourteen years. Finally, the counsel

urged that A-3 has suffered agony of trial for more than 37 years. He
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 16 of 201
 deserves acquittal due to long delay in disposal of the appeal. Since, there

is no minimum sentence provided under Section 307 IPC, the appellant

(A-3) can be acquitted under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
19.          Reliance was placed on the authorities : „V.M.Mathew vs.

V.S.Sharma and ors.‟, 1995 (6) SCC 122; „Shahbuddin vs. State of Delhi‟,

2012 VII Apex Decisions (Delhi) 711; „Sarwan Singh Rattan Singh vs.

20.          Learned Counsel for A-1 primarily argued on similar lines.

She relied on the judgments : „Arun Kumar Sharma vs. State of Bihar‟,

2010 (1) SCC 108; „Ranjit Singh vs. State‟, 1997 (V) AD (Delhi) 689;

21.          A-2 who argued in person urged that PW-Vikram was not a

reliable witness. After the Emergency came to an end in 1977, CID in

Bihar informed Bihar Government about the cases registered against

Anand Margies whereby CBI falsely implicated them to cover up the real

culprits. Bihar Government took the matter seriously and investigated it

through their officials. They found that approver Vikram was forced

through horrific torture to toe the line of CBI. He retracted his confession

via tape recording by the jail Superintendent and also verbally repeated

that statement to the Chief Secretary, Bihar. Chief Minister of Bihar,

requested Mr. Justice V.M.Tarakunde to give legal opinion. After

perusing the relevant documents of the case, Justice Tarakunde came to

the conclusion that case was false and was of the view that there should be

a fresh probe into the incident and innocent persons should be discharged.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 18 of 201
 PW- Vikram was directed to be recalled to confront him with the

statement recorded in Danapur jail but CBI deliberately opted not to

produce him. He further argued that there were various discrepancies,

omissions and improvements in the statements of the approver Vikram.

Moreover, he never attributed any role to him. A-2 was never present in

any meeting to have the slightest knowledge of existence of any such

conspiracy. PW-Vikram admitted that he did not know if A-2 was a

conspirator or not. He further argued that he had never shown the CJI to

A-1 in the Supreme Court. Moreover, this circumstance was not enough to

show his involvement in the conspiracy. The other alleged overt act that

he (A-2) obtained railway tickets for A-1 and A-3 in the fictitious names

is not incriminating in nature as the alleged conspiracy was hatched,

implemented and finished on 20.03.1975 itself. Moreover, these tickets

did not in any manner further the alleged conspiracy. At the relevant time,

A-1 was an accused in the self-immolation case of Acharya

Dhineshwarand. He was one of the lawyers for the „Organisation‟ at that

time. He did not communicate directly with A-1 but acted through a

„parokar‟. It cannot be assumed that he and A-1 had direct contact or vice

versa. Even for the sake of argument if in order to avoid arrest in self-

immolation case, A-1 or his parokar wanted to obtain train tickets on his
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 19 of 201
 behalf in some fictitious names for usual travel and requested him (A-2) to

book them, it was wholly reasonable as the said reservation for train

tickets did nothing whatsoever to assist or advance the cause of

conspiracy of 20.03.1975. A-2 was arrested during Emergency being a

follower of the banned „Organisation‟. A-2 had no motive to make an

attempt to murder the CJI. The Trial Court was not correct to conclude

that motive was sufficiently shown merely by drawing an interference of

his being an Anand Margi. The prosecution witnesses examined by the

police against A-2 were defectors from the „Organisation‟. The

„Organisation‟ to which A-2 was attached never preached violence. His

denial to be a follower of the „Organisation‟ in 313 statement cannot be

taken as an additional link to complete the chain as the prosecution was

required to stand on its own legs. A-2 further urged that he was never a

party to the criminal conspiracy and never participated in it in any form.

He relied upon the precedents : „State of T.N. vs. Nalini & ors.‟,1999 (5)

SCC 253; „Sharad Birdhi Chand vs. State of Maharastra‟, 1984 (4) SCC

116, „Kailash Gour & ors. vs. State of Assam‟, 2012 (2) SCC 34;

(C)          Submissions / Arguments on behalf of CBI

22.          Controverting the arguments of the appellants, learned

counsel for CBI urged that Vikram‟s evidence was reliable and it passed

the test of „General Reliability‟. It remained unshaken and un-impeached

despite grueling cross-examination spanning over eight days by as many

as four counsel. Vikram was able to recall material names, places, dates

and other relevant details. Evidence made by Vikram has been duly

corroborated in material particulars. The confession made by Vikram was

further corroborated in terms of the sequence of events i.e. the events and

conspiracy prior to the date of incident, as well as the events after escape

made by the accused persons from the site of incident. He further stressed

that the observations of Hon‟ble Supreme Court in order dated 19.01.2012

have been taken out of context and are being wrongly relied upon by the

appellants. These observations were only with respect to the limited

question of the calling the witness for re-examination. At no stage, did the

Supreme Court materially deal with the evidence given by Vikram before

the Trial Court nor did it juxtapose with alleged statements made before
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 21 of 201
 the jail authorities in Danapur. The Supreme Court never tested the

evidence of Vikram proved on the anvil of „reliability‟. The observations

at best constitute obiter and are not law in terms of Article 141 of the

Constitution of India. Vikram could not be produced for cross-

examination as he was not traceable despite sincere efforts made by CBI.

He was not available either in Delhi or his native place in Bihar. His

brother Parmanand informed that he last met him in the year 1980-1981 in

Danapur jail and after that his family had made efforts to trace him but

could not find him. His whereabouts are not known and it is doubtful if he

is still „alive‟ or „dead‟. Under Section 33 of the Evidence Act, Vikram‟s

statement is admissible. Evidence given by PW-Vikram in L.N.Misra case

is also admissible in the present proceedings where he (PW-Vikram)

clearly stated that his statements before jail authorities were obtained

against his wishes and were incorrect. He further urged that Vikram‟s

availability was not known to either of the parties when the matter was

pending before the Supreme Court. Vikram was discharged in this case in

1976 and was released on bail in L.N.Misra case in 1985. As the matter is

38 years old and he has not been heard or seen by any of his relatives who

would have naturally heard of him if he had been alive, it should be

presumed that he is „dead‟ under Section 108 of the Evidence Act and his
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 22 of 201
 evidence is admissible. CBI had no role when Vikram was released on

bail after 11 years. PW-Vikram was examined before the Courts eight

times at different stages and his stand remained consistent. Alleged

statements recorded before the Jail Authorities, Danapur, without any

authority of law and in complete violation of legal provisions were

inadmissible in evidence. Report of the Justice Tarakunde was only an

opinion and is not an admissible piece of evidence. There was a conflict of

interest as A-2 was junior of Justice Tarakunde and as a lawyer, had

appeared in the case on his behalf. The alleged retraction dated

30.09.1975 was in the knowledge of the appellants right through the

beginning and Vikram was confronted with such material in the year 1981

in L.N.Misra case. However, the appellants deliberately did not rake up

the said issue till 1998 for seeking summoning of Vikram for further

examination and waited for 17 years to ensure that Vikram would not be

available for further cross-examination. As per material available on

record, there is no doubt that Vikram was an accomplice with the

appellants in an attempt to murder the CJI.
23.          Counsel further urged that pardon under Section 306 granted

to him was legal as Vikram was very much part of the conspiracy and

played active role to achieve its object. The appellants never challenged
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 23 of 201
 the grant of pardon to him. From Vikram‟s evidence, it is clear that he has

made full and true disclosures of the whole of the circumstances within

his knowledge, involving himself directly in the crime and also specifying

the role played by the appellants. The investigation was honest, fair and

transparent. Gopalji, Mahender Pratap Singh and Abrol were not

proceeded with despite their arrest in the case.
24.          Apart from the evidence of Vikram, the independent

evidence of Raj Singh, Jai Nand, Inder Singh, Charan Singh, Tilak Raj

Bhatia and Parasnath clearly established that Vikram was an accomplice

and part of the conspiracy. The prosecution collected direct and

circumstantial evidence to corroborate approver Vikram in material

particulars. Documents Ex.P23 and Ex.P25 (requisition slips) and address

of A-1 at point Q20 in Ex.P127 (diary of A-2 which are in his hand)

coupled with oral evidence, proved complicity of A-2 in the conspiracy.

Once it is proved that the appellants had conspired to commit the murder

of CJI, acts, declarations and conduct (during the existence of the

conspiracy) of each of the conspirator in reference to their common

intention are admissible against them. He further urged that a false plea

taken in 313 statement can be considered as an additional circumstance if

other circumstances proved and established point out the guilt of the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 24 of 201
 accused. In the end, he urged that the sentence awarded to the appellants

is commensurate with the offence committed by them. Mere pendency of

appeal for the last about 37 years is no ground to modify or alter the

sentence. Reliance has been placed on : „SCBA vs. UOI‟, AIR 1998 SC

1895, „Amrit Das vs. State of Bihar‟, 2000 (5) SCC 488; „Municipal

Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kaur‟, 1989 (1) SCC 101; „Nagesh vs.

State of Karnatka‟, 2012 (6) SCC 477; „State of U.P. vs. M.K.Antony‟,

SCC 511; „K.Hasim vs. State‟, 2005 (1) SCC 237; „Mohd.Aman & anr. vs.

State of Rajasthan‟, 1997 (10) SCC 44 & „Ambika Prasad Thakur vs. Ram

Ekbal Raj‟, AIR 1966 SC 605.
(D)          Analysis and Appreciation of Evidence

25.          Before embarking on an evaluation of the rival submissions,

it would be apposite to note that the „Organisation‟ undeniably had no

hand in the crime. CBI did not implicate / suspect the „Organisation‟ in

any manner for any active or passive role in the crime. The „Organisation‟

cannot be condemned for individual acts of its followers for any criminal

activity. To say that CBI was not favourably disposed or had any malice /

bias towards it has no credible foundation.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 25 of 201
 26.          It is significant to note that prosecution case rests upon direct,

circumstantial and documentary evidence described in detail below. A

broad overview of the core evidence brought by the prosecution to bring

home the charges may now be discussed :
27.          PW-78 (Insp. Sajan Singh), SHO, PS Tughalak Road with his

police personnel rushed to the spot after getting information from the

Police Control Room at 04.40 P.M. and made futile attempt to locate the

culprit. After recording Jamadar - Jai Nand‟s statement (Ex.P16), he

lodged First Information Report and conducted required proceedings

about seizure of the car, „hawai‟ chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2) and

preparation of their sketches (Ex.P18 and Ex.P19). PW- Major Sharma

from the Army arrived and defused the hand-grenades. He got the crime

scene photographed. Statements of SI Om Parkash, Ramji Lal, Inder

Singh, Jai Nand, Major Sharma and Const. Jai Lal were recorded by him

that day. In the cross-examination, he disclosed that SI Om Parkash had

given him two digits of the number of the taxi as DLT-14 or 41.

28.          The investigation of the case was transferred to the Crime

Branch next day. There are no allegations that the FIR was manipulated,

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 26 of 201
 ante-timed or recorded after due deliberations and consultations. This

witness, obviously, had no extraneous consideration to make out a false

case against the appellants who were not even suspects that time.

29.          PW-85 (Sh.A.N.Ray), Chief Justice of India, stepped in the

witness box and gave detailed account of the occurrence without

implicating any individual. He deposed that some „object‟ had dropped

near the foot of his son on the mat after hitting on his left arm near the

shoulder. Within a split second, another „object‟ dropped in the car from

the right side and fell on the foot board. He further deposed that noting

„someone‟ running, Jamadar Jai Nand (PW-2) chased him towards Mandi

House. CJI was able to observe that fleeing man was a bit tallish and thin.

He further told that Jamadar who lived in the quarters attached to his

residence informed him in the evening that he was not able to catch that

man despite chase. He fairly admitted that he was not aware if the two

„objects‟ had been thrown in the car through two different windows. He

had no suspicion on anyone. He denied the suggestion that the two

„objects‟ already planted in the upper rack of the car in its rear portion had

fallen after the car stopped at the red signal. There was no basis /

foundation for such a suggestion which was not consistent with the

suggestions given to other witnesses.

 30.          PW-85‟s evidence is relevant to the extent that after the

„objects‟ were thrown inside the car, Jamadar - Jai Nand immediately got

out of it to chase the fleeing man shouting „pakro-pakro‟. The features of

the fleeing man i.e. tallish in height and thin from legs described by the

witness tallied with the physical feature of A-3. It corroborates PW-2‟s

version that two „objects‟ had fallen in quick succession.

31.          PW-6 (Inder Singh), driver in the targeted car was able to see

the assailant fleeing the spot and chased by PW-Jai Nand shouting „pakro-

pakro‟. He also succeeded to observe features and clothes worn by the

fleeing man which matched with the description given by other PWs. He

recorded his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. same day.

(b)          PW-2 (Jai Nand), PW-7 (Om Prakash), PW-33 (Ramji
             Lal) & PW-65 (Jai Lal) - Chasers - About the incident
             and identity of A-1 & A-3

32.          PW-2 (Jai Nand) Jamadar in the Supreme Court was attached

to CJI since 1969. His presence in the car at the time of attack is not under

challenge. He was in a position to observe the sequence of events

Insp.Sajjan Singh who went to the spot recorded Jai Nand‟s statement

(Ex.P-16). It formed the basis of First Information Report. This statement

made by PW-2 in the FIR brings out important facts leading to the offence


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 28 of 201
 and the part of the statement as quoted by the Trial Court in the impugned

judgment reads :

33.          The complainant gave a graphic detail of the incident at the

earliest available opportunity. He claimed to have witnessed the assailant


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 29 of 201
 who had thrown the hand-grenade in the car; described his identifying

features and asserted to identify him. While appearing as PW-2, Jai Nand

proved the version given to the police at the first instance without major

variations. He deposed that after hearing the „sound‟ of something falling

inside the car on the side on which son of the Chief Justice was sitting, he

looked that side, but could see nothing. When he turned behind, he saw

„another‟ person, standing on the side of the car where the Chief Justice

was sitting. The said „man‟ wrapped „something‟ in a handkerchief and

threw through the window at the place where CJI was sitting. He

explained that the said „man‟ had come close to the car. When he inquired

as to what he was doing, the „man‟ wearing a light blue shirt and pants of

brown colour, immediately ran away. He chased him shouting „pakro -

pakro‟. The said „individual‟ ran towards Bhagwan Dass Road and

entered into a waiting taxi at Bhagwan Dass Road but instantaneously

came out of it and ran. On hearing him „pakro - pakro‟, a constable from

DDA flats tried to catch hold of him but he succeeded eluding him (the

constable), and crossed the gate of Garhwal House. The witness further

stated that he saw one of the chappals being discarded by him on the right-

hand side of the car. The other chappal was discarded at some distance

from there. These were „hawai‟ chappals with a strap. He and other
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 30 of 201
 chasers crossed the Garhwal House in pursuit of the assailant. He could

see that „man‟ only up to the rear gate of the Garhwal House and

thereafter, he disappeared. After crossing the rear gate, he went up to

Haryana Bhawan but could not find the assailant. He returned to the scene

of occurrence at about 05.00 or 05.15 P.M. where the police had already

arrived. PW-2 (Jai Nand) identified A-3 to be the assailant who was

chased by him. He also identified A-1 to be the „individual‟ to whom he

had seen standing behind the car and „staring‟ around. He elaborated that

A-3 did not have any beard or long hair that time. He further deposed that

on July 30 or 31, 1975, he went to Tihar jail for identifying the culprits

but the identification parade did not take place.
34.          In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-1), the witness

revealed that the police recorded his statements in March, July and

August, 1975. He explained and clarified that he had only heard the

„sound‟ of the first article falling in the car and was unaware whether that

article was thrown inside the car from the left or right side. He was

emphatic that he only saw „one‟ man throwing an article into the rear seat

of the car only once and his description was given by him to the police.

He admitted the suggestion that the description of that „man‟ standing

behind the car was similar to that of A-1 minus his beard and long hair.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 31 of 201
 He denied the suggestion that he had mentioned about the „second‟ man

standing behind the car for the first time in his statement before CBI. The

witness was emphatic to say that he could not say definitely whether the

„man‟ to whom he had chased had thrown both the hand-grenades or only

one. He claimed that he saw A-1 face to face from close quarter. His

statement was recorded at about 06.00 P.M. at the spot and it took 15

minutes. The witness further revealed that he did not note the number of

the taxi.
35.          In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-3), he asserted that

the „man‟ to whom he saw on the left side rear window of the car was

standing hardly a half feet away from the car. He had thrust his hand

inside the car while throwing the hand-grenade. The said „man‟ had

already left the spot before his getting out of the car and he had chased

him shouting „pakro - pakro‟ and not „chor - chor‟. The witness further

revealed that window panes of the car were already down while leaving

the Supreme Court. He saw the face of the fleeing culprit thrice; First,

when he was standing near the car; second time when he entered into the

taxi; and lastly, when he was scaling the front gate for one or two seconds

each time. The distance between the taxi and the car was about 200 or 225

yards.

 36.           He elaborated that he only saw „something‟ falling in the

handkerchief and had heard the „Thud‟ of falling of the second article. He

denied the suggestion that he had seen „someone‟ else fleeing from the

scene of occurrence and that A-3 was falsely implicated at the instance of

the police.
37.           On scrutinizing the entire statement, it is clear that despite

searching and lengthy cross-examination, no material discrepancies could

be elicited to disbelieve the cogent and reliable version narrated by this

independent and natural witness who had no ulterior motive to give

detailed account of the occurrence and to describe the feature of the

assailant to whom he had seen fleeing from the spot (after throwing an

article inside the car). Presence of the witness and his reaction soon after

the occurrence to chase the culprit was quite natural and reasonable. His

presence with CJI was not accidental, but consistent with his duties. He

had no prior animosity or acquaintance with any of the accused to create a

false evidence at the instance of the police or CBI. None of the assailants

was named or implicated by him in his statement (Ex.P-16). The

discrepancies, omissions and improvements highlighted by learned

counsel for the appellants are not material to suspect his testimony in its

entirety. The horrible occurrence was sudden and unexpected. It was not
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 33 of 201
 expected from the witness to describe it minutely in the FIR. The primary

object of the FIR from the point of view of the informant is to set the

criminal law in motion. The prompt and early reporting of the occurrence

with all its vivid details gives an assurance regarding truth of the

prosecution version. It is vital and valuable piece of evidence for

appreciating the evidence led at the trial. It is manifest that an FIR is not

intended to be a very detailed document and is meant to give only the

substance of the allegations made.
               FIR is not an encyclopedia. It need not contain an exhaustive

account of the incident. Non-mentioning of minute details thereon does

not mean that the facts do not exist and its author was not aware of the

details. At that point of time, recording of the statement (Ex.P-16) was to

set the police machinery into motion. There is every possibility of minor

mismatch between the version recorded in 161 Cr.P.C. and the statement

given in Court. In „Naresh Kumar vs. State‟, 206 (2014) DLT (1) DB, this

Court held :

38.          PW-2 (Jai Nand), whenever confronted with the statement

(Ex.P-16) gave plausible explanation and clarified the mismatch. The

material facts deposed by him remained unchallenged and uncontroverted

in the cross-examination. Futile attempt was made to argue that the

witness had initially introduced the story of „one‟ assailant in the FIR.

Subsequently, in connivance with CBI, he made significant improvements

in his Court deposition and introduced the theory of „two‟ assailants who

had thrown the hand-grenades inside the car. Scanning the contents of the

FIR, it transpires that the witness was sure that a young „man‟ whose

description was given in the FIR had thrown an „object‟ in the rear seat of

the car. He did not in categorical terms rule out the presence of „some

one‟ else. In Court statement, he gave reasonable and acceptable

explanation. Apparently, the shocking incident had taken place

unexpectedly in a fraction of second. The occupants in the car were taken

by surprise and did not know as to what had really happened. The

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 35 of 201
 unprecedented event bewildered all of them. When PW-2 (Jai Nand)

heard the thud / noise / sound of an „object‟ falling in the car at the first

instance, his natural reaction was to turn back and find out as to what

exactly had happened. At that moment, he saw an „individual‟ standing on

the side of the car throwing the „object‟ through the open window. The

witness had even asked the „man‟ as to what he was doing. When the said

„individual‟ ran away, PW-2 immediately chased him shouting „pakro -

pakro‟. He did not state in so many words that the first „object‟ of which

he had heard the noise / thud was handiwork of the assailant who had

thrown the „object‟ through the window. He had not stated or disclosed

that both the objects were thrown inside the car by „one‟ and the same

individual. After return from unsuccessful chase to A-3, he found that two

hand-grenades were thrown inside the car. In the cross-examination, the

witness elaborated and explained that he was not a witness when the first

hand-grenade was thrown inside the car and had not seen the said

„assailant‟. During investigation, it revealed that A-1 was the assailant to

whom the witness had seen standing behind the car „staring‟ while the

other assailant who had thrown the hand-grenade had fled the spot and

was chased by him. Even in his deposition before the Court, PW-2 (Jai

Nand) did not depose if A-1 had thrown the object / hand-grenade inside
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 36 of 201
 the car. Neither this witness nor the investigating agency had any clue

about the perpetrators of the crime at that time. The appellants‟ contention

of introduction of „two‟ men theory subsequently is devoid of any merit.

39.          PW-2 (Jai Nand) made a positive identification of A-1 and

A-3 in the Court. Earlier, he had gone to Tihar Jail to participate in the

TIP. On July 30, 1975, A-1 and A-3 declined to join the TIP. In written

applications (Ex.P2 & Ex.P3), they attempted to justify refusal for non-

participation in TIP alleging that their faces remained uncovered and they

were shown to witnesses at the airport and out side the Courtroom where

they were produced. They, however, did not name the officer who had

directed them to uncover their faces. They also did not name any specific

individual to whom they were shown. No complaint was lodged or made

by them to the Metropolitan Magistrate before whom they were produced

that day. It is worthy to note that in the cross-examination, not a single

question was put to PW-2 (Jai Nand) if he had gone to Delhi Airport on

July 28, 1975 or at Tis Hazari Courts, or that he was among the

individuals who had seen them that day. The application for holding TIP

proceedings was moved in promptitude without any delay soon after the

culprits were brought to Delhi. Remand application (Ex.P-30) and order of

the Court (Ex.P-30/A) reflect that A-1 and A-3 were produced in muffled
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 37 of 201
 faces and no grievance was raised by them that time. PW-2 (Jai Nand) had

no extraneous consideration to falsely identify A-1 and A-3 in the Court.

It is trite to say that the substantive evidence is the evidence of

identification in Court. The facts, which establish the identity of the

accused persons are relevant under Section 9 of the Evidence Act. PW-2

(Jai Nand) had reasonable, fair and sufficient opportunity to observe and

note the broad features of the assailant (A-3) to whom he had seen

throwing the hand-grenade inside the car. The occurrence had taken place

during day time on March 20, 1975 when there was sufficient light at the

spot. It enabled PW-Jai Nand to identify the assailant. Not only PW-2 (Jai

Nand) had witnessed A-3 throwing the hand-grenade inside the car, he

had given a long chase and had seen him attempting to take shelter in the

taxi standing nearby and then coming out of it soon thereafter and

escaping after going inside the Garhwal House. It is quite possible for him

to remember the features of the assailant as he had direct confrontation /

encounter with A-3. No suggestion was put in the cross-examination that

the description given by the witness in FIR did not tally with the features

of A-3. Regarding A-1, the witness had merely a fleeting glance and had

purportedly seen him while standing behind the car after he had come out

of the car to chase A-3. He did not describe his features at that time.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 38 of 201
 Corroboration will be required to establish A-1‟s identity in these

circumstances.
40.          On a consideration of the evidence, this Court holds its

disagreement with the Trial Court that the prosecution had failed to

establish by the evidence of PW-2 (Jai Nand) with regard to identification

of the culprits. In „Harijana Thiru Pala and Others vs. Public Prosecutor,

High Court of Andhra Pradesh‟, Supereme Court observed : ""Doubtless

the High Court in appeal either against an order of acquittal or

conviction as a Court of first appeal has full power to review the evidence

to reach to its own conclusion ""
41.          A fair reading of the evidence tendered by this witness makes

it evident that he has stated the facts seen by him in a simple manner

without any noticeable embellishments. What is mentioned by the witness

is that he had seen A-3 running and „hurriedly‟ entering into the taxi and

fleeing thereafter. It was not explained by A-3 what made him to run away

from the spot, entering into taxi and then disappearing from the spot.

Nothing was suggested if A-1 or A-3 were available outside Delhi. PW-2
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 39 of 201
 is certain about the identity of A-3 and the role played by him in the

occurrence.
42.           Another equally important witness is PW-7 (Om Prakash)

who was posted in Special Branch of CID in March, 1975 and was on ten

days‟ leave for preparation of LLM studies. He lived in quarter No. 4,

Type-III at Tilak Marg. On March 20, 1975, at about 04.15 P.M., he was

going on cycle to his flat from the side of Tilak Bridge. He deposed that

when he reached near the traffic lights, he heard people shouting „pakro -

pakro‟at Bhagwan Dass Road. He saw an „individual‟ in white uniform

with a white turban (identified PW-2) chasing the culprit wearing a blue

shirt, badami pants, slim in body, sanwla complexion, short moustaches

and hair. He joined the chasers. The fleeing man entered into a taxi

standing at Bhagwan Dass Road near DDA flats; soon came out of it; fled

towards Garhwal House and entered into it by scaling over its gate. He

identified A-3 to be the individual who was being chased. He further

deposed that A-3 was unable to be caught and he returned to the spot. He

also saw two „chappals‟ lying on the right side of the car. He identified A-

3 at R.K.Puram after he declined to join TIP in Tihar.
43.           In the cross-examination, he stated that Jai Nand (PW-2) was

with him on return to the scene of occurrence from Haryana Bhawan. He
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 40 of 201
 admitted that in his statement (Ex.D8) to the CBI, he had given the

number of the taxi, DLT something like ""14‟, „49‟ or „69"". He admitted

that in his statements (Ex.D18 and Ex.D19), he had not mentioned about

the „chappals‟ lying at the spot. He denied the suggestion that statement

given by him in the Court was a hearsay account given to him by the

Jamadar on their way back.
44.          Replying to the question put on behalf of the A-3, he recalled

that it was Jamadar who was shouting „pakro - pakro‟. He denied the

suggestion that he had to wait at the traffic lights for 50 seconds from the

time he had heard „pakro - pakro‟ until the traffic light turned green. He

explained that face of the fleeing culprit was seen thrice; first when he

entered the taxi; second when he came out of it and third when he scaled

over the rear gate for 10-15 seconds each time. He denied that false

evidence was given by him expecting departmental promotion.

45.          On examination of the testimony of this independent witness,

it transpires that he has corroborated the version given by PW- Jai Nand

without major variations. Presence of this witness was natural and

probable as he had residential accommodation in flats at Tilak Marg near

the crime spot and had given chase to an „unknown‟ culprit. It cannot be

accepted that he was a planted witness. His statement under Section 161
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 41 of 201
Cr.P.C. was recorded the same day when even the identity of the

assailants was not known. The witness being in responsible official job

was not expected to falsely implicate an innocent one. He gave minute

detail of the sequence of event which prompted him to chase the fleeing

culprit even though he was not aware as to what was the offence

committed by him. Being a police officer, his natural instant reaction on

hearing the shouts of „pakro - pakro‟ was to chase the fleeing culprit. In

the performance of his duty, among other chasers, he attempted to catch

hold of the fleeing man. Soon after return to the spot, he described the

salient features of the fleeing man and volunteered to participate in the

TIP. In Court, he had no hesitation to recognize and identify A-3 to whom

he had given an unsuccessful chase. In the absence of prior animosity or

ill-will, this witness had no extraneous consideration to falsely identify

him. It is true that for certain omissions in the statements (Ex.D18 and

Ex.D19) recorded by police and CBI, he has been confronted. However,

these omissions or improvements do not discredit the version given by

him on material facts. Presence of this witness at the spot was not

challenged in the cross-examination.
46.          Another important witness on similar facts examined by the

prosecution is PW-65 (Jai Lal, Ex. Constable). In March, 1975, he was
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 42 of 201
 posted in the demolition squad of the DDA at Vikas Bhawan and was on

duty at the residence of Sh. Jag Mohan, Vice Chairman, DDA, flat No. 1

at 7, Bhagwan Dass Road, New Delhi. On March 20, 1975, at about 04.15

P.M., after hearing shouts of „pakro - pakro‟, he went out on the patari

and witnessed 4 or 5 persons coming from Tilak Marg side chasing a

culprit who wanted to enter the DDA flats. Being at the gate, he stood

ready to catch hold of him but the assailant jumped over into Garhwal

House locked at that time after eluding him. He prompted PW-Ramji Lal

on duty in the inquiry office to block him near the rear gate of Garhwal

House. PW-Jai Lal identified A-3 to be the assailant to whom he had

chased unsuccessfully. In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-1), he

further highlighted that a taxi was standing at a distance of nearly 50 yards

from the gate.
47.          In the cross-examination (conducted by A-3), he explained

that he saw the face of the culprit only once when he came face to face

while he stood poised for catching hold of him in his arm. He reasoned for

not running towards the culprit to catch hold of him, because he himself

was coming to his direction to enter the gate.
48.          On a consideration and appraisement of the deposition of this

independent public witness, it reveals that he had no concern with Delhi
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 43 of 201
 police or CBI and was on duty at the relevant time near the spot. It makes

him a credible and reliable witness and his testimony inspires implicit

confidence. He was not acquainted with the fleeing man and was not

aware as to what crime he had committed. Being on duty at the residence

of Vice Chairman, DDA it was natural for him to chase the fleeing man

after hearing shouts of „pakro - pakro‟. He joined other chasers to

apprehend the fleeing man whose identity was not known to him. In his

statement recorded on the same day by Delhi police, he gave detailed

account of the occurrence and unsuccessful chase. The witness had direct

confrontation with the fleeing man who wanted to enter DDA flats to

escape. When this witness got ready to apprehend him, he eluded him and

went inside the Garhwal House by jumping into it. Again, this witness

chased him to that place. Presence of this witness at the spot has not been

denied or disputed. No ulterior motive was assigned to him to make false

statement. The name of this witness emerged on the day of occurrence

itself. The fact that the fleeing man was not named by him shows that he

had no animosity with anyone to fabricate a false story. The witness had

clear and reasonable opportunity to observe broad features of the fleeing

man as his face was seen by him from close quarters during day time. He

was transferred after 2 or 3 days of the occurrence and nothing has
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 44 of 201
 emerged if he remained in contact with the police thereafter to see the

culprit at the time of his production in the Court. In the absence of any

material inconsistency, I find his testimony in consonance with the

testimonies of PW - SI Om Prakash and PW-Jai Nand. All these

witnesses unequivocally identified A-3 to be the assailant chased by them

soon after the crime.
49.          PW-33 (Ramji Lal Sharma) working as Assistant Wireman at

DDA Flats situated at No.7, Bhagwan Dass Road, deposed on similar

lines. On hearing the shouts of „pakro - pakro‟, he was among the chasers

to apprehend the culprit who disappeared after scaling Garhwal House.

PW-33 (Ramji Lal Sharma) recognized A-3 to be the culprit who was

chased by him that time. Presence of the witness being on official duty is

not under challenge. He corroborated the version given by other chasers

and also saw A-3, entering into a taxi standing nearby. He claimed that he

had seen the face of the culprit for 2 / 3 seconds. He admitted the

suggestion that ""it is correct that on turning into the Bhagwan Dass Road,

I had gone up to traffic lights and stopped there."" Apparently, the version

given by the witness to have chased the assailant has not been denied.

This official witness having no animosity with A-3 had no reason to

falsely implicate him. Presence of this witness emerged on the day of
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 45 of 201
 incident itself when Delhi Police recorded his statement under Section 161

Cr.P.C.
50.          From the statements of the witnesses referred above, it stands

established that after hand-grenades were thrown inside the car of the CJI,

PW - Jai Nand and others gave a chase to the fleeing assailant. The said

assailant after discarding the „hawai‟ chappals at the spot ran to escape in

a taxi standing nearby and entered into it hurriedly. He immediately came

out of it and jumped into Garhwal House to avoid apprehension by the

chasers including PW - Jai Nand. But for this exercise, there was every

possibility of his apprehension as the gap between the two was very short.

Since the occurrence had taken place during broad day light in March, the

chasers had clear and sufficient opportunity to observe and note the broad

features of the said man. The description and identifying features of the

fleeing man were described / mentioned by the chasers in their statements

recorded soon after the incident. The assailant was subsequently,

identified as A-3 in the Court by the witnesses at the time of their

examination. Adverse inference is to be drawn against A-3 for not

participating in TIP without justifiable reasons. A-3 had fled the spot soon

after the „object‟ was thrown by him from the left window of the car.

Jamadar even had some confrontation when he enquired from him as to
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 46 of 201
 what he was doing. A-3 did not give plausible explanation as to what had

led him to be present there to throw the „object‟ inside the car. A-3 was

unable to explain as to why he was running away from that place. No

suggestion was put in the cross-examination to any witness that on the

relevant date and time, A-3 was available / present at a different specific

place. In 313 statement, A-3 did not claim his presence at any other

particular place. He claimed that he did not return to Delhi, after he left it

in the end of 1970. However, he was conspicuously silent as to where else

his place of residence or work was thereafter. It was imperative for A-3

facing serious allegations of a murderous assault on CJI to specifically

disclose his presence on that day at a particular place of residence / job.

However, he did not reveal anything. Adverse inference under Section

106 Evidence Act is to be drawn against A-3 as these facts which were

within his special knowledge were not divulged. In 313 statement, he

admitted his arrest along with Vikram on July 24, 1975, at Bhagalpur.

Again, he did not explain as to how he had come into contact with Vikram

and how they happened to be together at Bhagalpur for any specific

purpose. A-3 holding an important position as „Avadhoot‟ in the

„Organization‟, disclosed that after he left Delhi, he went to different

places including Madras and Bombay. However, he did not examine any
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 47 of 201
 witness or produce any document to show that he continued to work

regularly at a particular place till 20 March, 1975. He also did not produce

any document to show his whereabouts from March 20, 1975 to July 24,

1975 when he was arrested. This small piece of evidence showing his

presence at his place of job or residence would have exonerated him of all

the charges.
(c)            PW-5 (Charan Singh) - Movement on day of incident and
               identity of A-1 & A-3

51.            The prosecution examined PW-5 (Charan Singh), an illiterate

licenced taxi driver plying taxi (DLT-1469 make Ambassador) at Gole

Market, Taxi Stand for the last ten years. He is the most crucial natural

witness having no affiliation with any of the parties. No ulterior motive

was attributed to him for making false statement. He had no criminal

antecedents and never appeared as a witness in any criminal case.

52.            In his Court statement, he gave detailed account of the

occurrence that took place on 20.03.1975. He elaborated that on that day

at about 02.00 P.M. at Gole market, Taxi Stand, an old man (identified as

Tilak Raj Bhatia - PW-4) hired the taxi for sight-seeing and took him to

his companions standing at a distance of 20 / 25 yards (identified as A-1,

A-3 and PW-Vikram). They occupied the rear seat and Tilak Raj Bhatia

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 48 of 201
 sat next to him in the front seat. The taxi was first taken to Budha Jayanti

Park where all of them went inside it to return after 15 / 20 minutes.

Thereafter, it was taken to India Gate via Shanker Road and Rail Bhawan.

There, they all consumed ice cream from an ice-cream vendor. All the

passengers except Tilak Raj Bhatia went to Amar Jawan Jyoti. After

returning to the taxi, A-1 ordered to take the taxi to Children‟s Park.

Again, they all except Tilak Raj Bhatia went inside Children‟s Park and

returned after 15 or 20 minutes. A-1 thereafter, asked him to hurry up to

Bhagwan Dass Road as they had to meet someone there or else would

miss him. He drove to Bhagwan Dass Road by the side of Patiala House

Court via Tilak Marg and stopped the taxi at the left hand side of

Bhagwan Dass Road near an electric pole. All the three passengers in the

rear seat got out of the taxi, asking Tilak Raj Bhatia to wait in the taxi.

After about ten minutes, he heard the voice of „pakro - pakro‟ from the

side of Tilak Marg. A man (identified A-3) came running from that side

wanted to enter into the taxi from left hand side rear door but he was not

allowed to do so as it was not available for hire. A-3, wore a blue shirt,

Badami colour pants and was barefoot. He went into Garhwal House after

scaling its closed gate. 5 or 7 persons chased him shouting „pakro - pakro‟

and two of them crossed the gate of the Garhwal House in his pursuit. He
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 49 of 201
 further deposed that A-1 returned to the taxi after 2 or 3 minutes of A-3‟s

entry in the Garhwal House and asked him to drive him to Connaught

Circus. Since he had some doubts, he refused to go and got his fare `

18.50/- as per meter reading. Thereafter, A-1 and Tilak Raj Bhatia went

away in the direction of Supreme Court and he drove the taxi to

Connaught Place. PW-Charan Singh further elaborated that A-1 had

carried a black colour bag in his hand inside the taxi; he took it with him

while going inside Budha Jayanti park and Children‟s Park. At Bhagwan

Dass Road, when the passengers sitting in the left rear seat (A-1, A-3 and

Vikram) went out, they left behind the black bag in the taxi. PW-Charan

Singh identified A-1 in the Court adding that he had no beard, long hair

and moustaches that time. After recognising A-3 in the Court, he recalled

that he had occupied middle rear seat and had disappeared in Garhwal

House. He identified Vikram, the approver, to be their third companion.

53.          He further deposed that in the 7th month of the year 1975, the

police along with Tilak Raj Bhatia approached him at Gole Market, Taxi

Stand. He recognised him (PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia) and thereafter, he was

taken to R.K.Puram. He and Tilak Raj Bhatia went to Central Jail Tihar

for participation in identification parade which did not take place. After 10

/ 12 days, he was called at R.K.Puram where Vikram and A-3 were shown
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 50 of 201
 to him. His taxi in question was seized which he got released on

„superdari‟.
               In the cross-examination, he explained that after purchase of

the taxi from Naldev Singh, he was plying it for the last four years and his

badge number was 15262. He was in prescribed khaki uniform that day.

He described the details of the route taken to finally reach Bhagwan Dass

Road. He informed that the three individuals were visible to him for a

distance of 5 / 7 yards at Bhagwan Dass Road till they separated from

each other. About Vikram, he informed that he did not see him crossing

into the Garhwal House. Vikram did not return to the taxi. He denied the

suggestion that he had demanded money from the accused persons to pay

off ` 8,000/- debt to Gurdial Singh and on their refusal, the false

statement was given. He claimed that he did not owe money to anyone.

He disclosed that A-1 was wearing canvas shoes, whereas Vikram and

Tilak Raj Bhatia were in black leather shoes and boots respectively. He

stated that Tilak Raj Bhatia did not ask the three passengers as to whom

they wanted to meet and why they were in a hurry. He admitted that he

did not catch hold of A-3 to prevent him from entering the taxi. He came

to know about the incident the following day. On return to the taxi stand,

he did not talk to any of his friends or colleagues as to what had happened.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 51 of 201
 He denied the suggestion that he was taken into custody and was beaten

by the police at R.K.Puram.
54.          I have critically examined the evidence tendered by this

witness. His version appears to be natural and probable. The appellants

could not elicit any material discrepancies or contradictions in the cross-

examination to disbelieve the version narrated by him minutely; his

deposition on material facts remained unchallenged and unrebutted.

Barring minor omissions in his earlier statements (Ex.D-9 and Ex.D-10),

there were no noticeable improvements or deviations. No oblique motive

was assigned to this illiterate and rustic witness to implicate the

appellants. He had neither any grudge to grind against the appellants nor

anything has been suggested to him. He was not acquainted with them. He

had witnessed the sequence of events while performing his duty as taxi

driver and had taken the passengers from one destination to other on

payment of fare. He identified A-1 and A-3 besides approver Vikram and

PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia) in the Court to be the passengers who had

travelled in the taxi on that day and had ultimately left them at Bhagwan

Dass Road near the place of incident. He had visited Tihar jail to

participate in TIP which the assailants declined to join. PW-5 gave vivid

and detailed account as to how the passengers had visited various places
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 52 of 201
 before arriving at the spot. The accused persons did not deny their

presence in the taxi that day. They did not offer reasonable explanation of

their visit to various places prior to arriving at the crime scene; did not

give any justification for abandoning their idea to go for sight-seeing.

Apparently, the assailants before arriving at the destination had taken the

taxi here and there to squander the time. His omission to report the

incident to the police at the first instance does not dilute or dent his

testimony. Moreover, he was not sure as to what really had happened or if

the passengers in the taxi were the real assailants. Being unacquainted

with the appellants, there was least possibility of this witness to lodge

report with the police. His statement inspires complete confidence as he

had no attachment / connection with the „Organisation‟ to which the

assailants belonged. His entire version is in consonance with the

testimony of PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia and that of approver- Vikram. CBI was

not aware of him and reached to him when PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia) took

them to Gole Market, Taxi Stand where he was expected to be present

with taxi. To lend credence to his testimony certain suggestions put to him

in the cross-examination are worth-noting. ""It is correct that when they

hired my taxi, the meter showed the minimum charges at ` 1.60; I deny

the suggestion that I could not recognise Sudevanand (A-3) and that I
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 53 of 201
 refused to let him enter the taxi thinking that the same had been hired by

other passengers; I deny the suggestion that a police man came to me and

arrested me and thereafter he asked me that I would not be released unless

I told the whole thing to him."" There exist no ground to eschew his

evidence especially when the Trial Court found his evidence trustworthy

and relied upon it. He candidly stated all that he had seen. The tenor of his

evidence is such that it is not possible to say that he has falsely implicated

the accused. His evidence has a ring of truth. When he suspected

something amiss, he refused to carry the passengers further.

(d)          PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia) - Conspiracy, Movements on the
             day of incident - identity of A-1 & A-3

55.          Star witness examined by the prosecution is PW-4 (Tilak Raj

Bhatia). Undisputedly, he was ardent follower of the „Organisation‟ since

1966 having complete faith in it. However, in 1973, he drifted from the

said „Organisation‟ due to self-immolation by some followers to secure

release of Anand Murti @ Baba. Notwithstanding that, he continued to

maintain previous contacts and connections with his fellows and stood

surety for Gunadhishanand and other after the self-immolation episode.

He and A-1 were known to each other since 1969 and gradually the

familiarity grew. A-1, an accused in the self-immolation case was wanted

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 54 of 201
 by police. It is not clear whether he was Proclaimed Offender. However,

PW-84 (R.L.Bhagat, Advocate) who represented State as Addl. Public

Prosecutor in case titled „State vs. Acharya Puriyanand and Others‟ was

certain that A-1 was a Proclaimed Offender. PW-4 deposed that A-1

established connection with him in June or July, 1974 when he (A-1)

came at his shop at Punchkuin Road and took him to Pusa Institute where

he was introduced to PW- Shiv Raj Singh in a park. A-1 visited him again

next day at his shop and took him to the hostel where Shiv Raj Singh

stayed. A-1 requested him to arrange / procure arms and ammunitions and

to remain in contact with Shiv Raj Singh. A-1 again met him in January,

1975 at his shop and enquired about delay in procuring the arms.
56.          In Court statement, PW-4 corroborated the version given by

PW-5 (Charan Singh), taxi driver, on all relevant and material facts. He

deposed that on 20.03.1975, A-1 came at his shop at about 02.00 P.M. and

took him to Rama Krishna Marg near Punchkuin Road on the pretext to

have something urgent to talk. A-1 introduced him with his two

companions, one of whom (Vikram) was already known to him. The other

(A-3) had purportedly come from Bihar for sight-seeing. On A-1‟s

request, he hired a taxi of a Sardarji from Gole Market, Taxi Stand. He

further deposed that they all i.e. A-1, A-3 and Vikram took seats in the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 55 of 201
 rear seat of the car and he sat next to the taxi driver in the front seat.

Thereafter, the taxi was taken to Budha Jayanti Park where they all four

went inside the park with the bag. After return to the taxi within 15 or 20

minutes, they went to India Gate and ate ice creams from an ice-cream

vendor for which payment was made by A-1. Leaving him and the taxi

driver, the trio went to Amar Jawan Jyoti; returned after 10 minutes;

occupied their original seats in the taxi and proceeded to Children‟s Park.

On return after 10 or 15 minutes, they appeared to be in a hurry. A-1

commanded the taxi driver to hurry up to Bhagwan Dass Road as he had

to meet someone there or else they would miss him. The taxi drove to

Bhagwan Dass Road via Stadium and Tilak Marg and the driver stopped it

at Bhagwan Dass Road near an electric pole by the side of DDA flats

facing Connaught Circus at about 04.00 P.M. A-1, A-3 and Vikram got

out the taxi and went away towards Supreme Court telling them to wait.

After a little while, the driver and he came out of the taxi. Vikram stopped

at the corner of DDA flats at the crossing; A-1 stood at the opposite corner

of the crossing of Bhagwan Dass Road and Tilak Marg and A-3 stopped at

the traffic lights towards Supreme Court. The witness further disclosed

that after 5 or 7 minutes, noise of „Pakro-Pakro, Bhag Gaya - Bhag Gaya‟

attracted his attention and he saw an individual (identified as A-3) running
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 56 of 201
 bare foot; entering the taxi by opening the door. Since the taxi did not

start, A-3 immediately exited and ran towards Garhwal House. A

Constable came running from the side of DDA flats, attempted to

intercept but he eluded him and scaled the closed gate of Garhwal House

and went inside it. 4 or 5 other chasers were unsuccessful to catch hold of

him. He and the taxi driver were in a fix as to what had happened. Soon,

A-1 came from Supreme Court side and commanded the driver to take the

taxi to Connaught Circus. On getting suspicious, the driver declined and

got his fare ` 18/-. A-1 took his black bag from the taxi and they both

proceeded towards Tilak Bridge. When he enquired from A-1 about his

two companions, he advised him to keep quiet. After A-1 parted company

at the juncture of Sikandra road and Tilak Marg, he came to his shop by a

bus and did not see A-1‟s companions thereafter.
57.          In the cross-examination, he reiterated the version stated in

examination-in-chief and did not deviate on material aspects. Despite

searching and detailed cross-examination, nothing cogent and material

could be extracted to shatter his testimony or to disbelieve him. No

ulterior motive was assigned to this witness implicating the accused

persons with whom he had strong bonds being followers of the same

„Organisation‟. He admitted that he did not report the police about the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 57 of 201
 incident after reading about it in the newspaper on 21.03.1975. He

explained that he did not do so due to fear and was apprehensive of

elimination like other defectors. He denied the suggestion that he was

threatened by the police to give the evidence as desired or else he would

be arrayed as an accused. He had no acquaintance with the taxi driver

before and denied that he was connected with him since partition days. He

explained that CBI officials met him after the occurrence in July, 1975 at

his shop and enquired if he knew A-1. Thereafter, at Gole Market, Taxi

Stand, he identified PW-5 (Charan Singh) whose taxi was hired that day.

In para No.31 of the cross-examination, the witness gave graphic detail of

the route taken by them from Gole Market from where the taxi started and

finally halted at Bhagwan Dass Road. In the cross-examination (on behalf

of the A-3), the witness disclosed that he had participated in Satyagraha at

Delhi after the case of self-immolation at Delhi to secure the release of

Baba. Suggestion was put that he knew very well that A-1 was a fugitive

from justice and that he went along with him at that time because he

wanted to help him. He came to know about A-1‟s arrest in July 1975. He

denied the suggestion that the code word ""Foreign radio"" was suggested

by him. He denied that he had taken all the three persons along with him

right up to the taxi stand. In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-1), he
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 58 of 201
 disclosed that he had pointed out towards a taxi driver at the taxi stand

when he came out of the taxi after 30 or 40 minutes of their reaching. He

denied the suggestion that in his statement recorded earlier he had not

given the number of taxi as it could result in its seizure. He admitted that

in his statement (Ex.D7) from portion „B‟ to „B‟, he did not mention that

A-3 had opened the door of his taxi, got into it and then came out. He

explained that actually that was what had happened. He admitted that he

did not see the „chappals‟ at Tilak Marg.
58.          I have scanned the testimony of this crucial witness. The

defence has not made any dent in his evidence by cross-examining him.

Certain omissions / improvements in his earlier statements recorded

before the CBI / Court were not enough to discredit his testimony in its

entirety. Various suggestions put to him in the cross-examination lend

credence to the prosecution case about the presence of this witness in the

taxi in question. PW-4 had arranged the taxi in question from a Taxi Stand

at Gole Market near his place of work and had accompanied the appellants

without nurturing any suspicion as it was pretended that A-3 who had

come from Patna would like to go for sight-seeing in the taxi. Since the

taxi was taken at different locations i.e. India Gate, Children‟s Park,

Buddha Park before arriving at the place of occurrence, this witness had
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 59 of 201
 no reasons to doubt or suspect the bonafide of A-1 with whom he was

associated since long and did not nurture any grudge. Apparently, he was

not aware of the plan to be executed by A-1, A-3 and approver Vikram

that day. He was very much used by A-1 without letting him know of his

exact plan. His testimony is in consonance with PW-5 (Charan Singh).

PW-4 and PW-5 corroborate the version given by approver Vikram

regarding the incident that took place on March 20, 1975. Assertions on

relevant facts have remained unchallenged and uncontroverted in the

cross-examination. PW-4 even did not lodge any complaint with the

police about the incident apparently to save the culprits. Only when the

police reached to him after A-1‟s disclosures, he divulged the sequences

of the events that occurred on March 20, 1975. PW-4‟s statement

describes the occurrence in its proper course. I do not find it appropriate to

discard his statement as not inspiring confidence. The statements of the

witness must be appreciated in proper perspective.
(e)          Extrajudicial confessions - Made by A-1 - Evidentiary
             Value


59.          The next important piece of evidence / circumstance relied

upon by the prosecution is extra judicial confessions alleged to have been

made by A-1 to PW-44 (Ranbir Singh), PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) and PW-
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 60 of 201
 57 (Raj Singh), soon after the incident. PW-55 deposed that on March 20,

1975 at about 09.00 P.M. at A-1‟s instance, he called PW-Ranbir Singh in

his room. A-1 gave them a „draft‟ written in Hindi to prepare its copies.

He further testified that on reading the draft, they found that it contained

matter about the hand-grenades thrown at CJI earlier that evening.

Thereupon, at their enquiry, A-1 told them ""he (A-1) and his companion

had thrown bombs at the Chief Justice and that the said bombs had not

exploded"". He also stated in the context that ""it was the Baba‟s iccha that

Sh.Ray may live longer for some time so that he could mend his ways.""

             PW-44 also deposed on similar lines and corroborated the

version of PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) without deviation. He deposed that A-

1 during his frequent visits to Shiv Raj Singh in PG hostel after 1972 used

to call him in his room in the hostel. On March 20, 1975 at about 08.30 or

09.00 P.M. A-1 called him through Shiv Raj Singh in his room; gave them

a Hindi draft to make number of copies. When they read the draft and

found that there was mention of throwing of hand-grenades on the car of

CJI, Shiv Raj Singh asked A-1 as to what all that was about. A-1 made the

above referred confession. PW-Ranbir was fair enough to admit in the

cross-examination that A-1 had not given the names of his companions

and they on their own, did not enquire about their number and other
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 61 of 201
 details from him. The reason for this was that they were afraid of A-1 and

wanted to cut the matter short; they were not interested in knowing the

number of his companions and their names. He further admitted that he

did not tell any of these things to his wife or the police.

60.          PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) further deposed that second

extrajudicial confession was made by A-1 when he visited him on March

24, 1975 at about 09.00 or 10.00 A.M. He told him that they had

succeeded in achieving the object of writing those copies etc. because the

same had been published in the papers. He boasted saying, ""See, we had

done the L.N.Mishra kand and I and my companions had thrown hand-

grenades into the car of Chief Justice of India. So long as the Baba‟s

icchha was with us, none of us can be discovered and arrested"". There is

no cross-examination on this aspect.
61.          Another confessional statement about the crime was made to

PW-57 (Raj Singh) with whom A-1 had close association since the time

he joined the „Organisation‟ in 1967. A-1 was frequent visitor to his

house. On 19th March 1975, he, A-3 and Vikram had stayed at his

residence. After the occurrence on March 20, 1975, A-3 came to his house

at about 05.45 P.M. in a nervous state of mind. As per Raj Singh‟s

testimony, he was perplexed. A-1 also arrived there at about 06.30 P.M.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 62 of 201
 PW- Raj Singh recalled that both A-1 and A-3 embraced, kissed and

congratulated each other. They left his house advising him to remove all

literature concerning the „Organisation‟. PW-Raj Singh further deposed

that on March 21, 1975 morning when he was reading „The Nav-Bharat

Times‟ carrying news of unsuccessful attempt on the life of CJI, A-1

arrived there. He confronted A-1 with the news and enquired if it was

their handiwork. On that, A-1 nodded in affirmation. The exact words

uttered were :
62.          In the cross examination, A-1 did not put any suggestion

denying the above confession. PW-57 (Shiv Raj Singh) recalled that when
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 63 of 201
 he requested A-1 to leave him alone as he was a government servant, he

(A-1) got enraged and threatened that if he disclosed any such thing, he

would meet the same fate as had been felled L.N.Misra.

             Extra judicial confessions described above before PW-Shiv

Raj Singh, PW-Ranbir Singh and PW-Raj Singh on various dates have

remained un-challenged and un-assailed in the cross-examination and

were never retracted. There was nothing unusual for A-1 to make extra

judicial confessions to these persons as they were not strangers to him and

he had reposed complete confidence in them. A-1 was in close association

with them since long and had taken their assistance for the execution of

his plan about which they were not aware. A-1 had requested PW-55

(Shiv Raj Singh) to provide accommodation in the hostel in the assumed

name. PW-44 (Ranbir Singh) was even requested to procue arms to get

Baba released through violent means. A-1 had approached them after the

occurrence to prepare copies of draft. It was reasonable and natural

spontaneous reaction of the PW-55 and PW-44 to enquire on reading

contents of the draft as to how the incident had taken place. A-1 cunningly

did not divulge the names of his companions who were associated with

him in throwing of the bombs. A-1 and his associates took shelter at the

residence of PW-Raj Singh on the night intervening 19/20.03.1975. A-1
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 64 of 201
 handed over certain letters to PW- Raj Singh to post at GPO. These

witnesses came to know about A-1‟s involvement about throwing of the

hand-grenades on CJI‟s car only when extra judicial confessions were

made by him. These witnesses did not nurture any grievance against A-1

prior to the incident and had assisted him at various stages as per his

request without having inkling of his nefaroius plan. They had no

extraneous reasons to make false statements.
63.          In the instant case, the extra judicial confessions made by A-

1 are free from any suspicion as to their voluntary character and have also

a ring of truth in it. There is nothing improbable in A-1‟s making extra

judicial confessions to these independent witnesses. The witnesses have

reproduced the exact words used by A-1 as nearly as possible to convey

that A-1 and his companions were the perpetrators of the crime. These

extra judicial confessions can be relied upon along with other evidence for

conviction and are incriminating circumstances against A-1.

             The Court is not oblivious of the fact that evidence about

extra judicial confession in the very nature of things is a weak piece of

evidence. But in a case where the evidence of extra judicial confession on

scrutiny is found to be free from legal infirmity and the Court believes the

witnesses before whom the confession is made and is satisfied that the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 65 of 201
 confession was voluntarily, then in such a case conviction can be based on

such evidence. The law does not require that the evidence of extra judicial

confession should in all cases be corroborated. In „State of U.P. vs.

M.K.Anthony‟, AIR 1985 SC 48, the Supreme Court observed :
64.          Considering the consistency and the coherence of the

statements of the independent witnesses bearing on the confessions of the

accused, the Court is satisfied that their evidence to the said effect is

untainted and true. The confessions made by A-1 voluntarily in the normal

course without any pressure, are direct acknowledgment of the guilt of the

offence in question. The confessions contain a probable catalogue of

events and there is nothing improbable or unbelievable in it. These appear

to be spontaneous account studded with such vivid details about

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 67 of 201
 background and the manner of committing of crime in question which

only perpetrator of crime could know. Moreover, the confessions fit in

well with the rest of the evidence and other facts and surrounding

circumstances discussed in this judgment. The evidence relating to these

extra-judicial confessions is found credible after being tested on the touch

stone of credibility and acceptability. These can solely form the basis of

conviction qua A-1.
(f)          Stay at PW-57 Raj Singh's residence on the night
             intervening 19/20.03.1975 - PW-Vikram, A-1 and A-3.

65.          PW-57 (Raj Singh), Post-graduate of 1956, resident of

Mehrauli, a government servant with Municipal Corporation of Delhi as

School Inspector (Physical Education) was also follower of the

„Organisation‟ since 1967 and used to participate in its various activities.

He was acquainted with A-1, A-3 and PW-Vikram who used to visit and

stay occasionally at his residence while going to perform „Kapalik

Sadhana‟ near his residence. He deposed that in April, 1974, A-1 came to

his newly built house at about 10.00 P.M. At first instance, he had a little

difficulty to recognize him as he had removed his beard and cut his hair

short. A-1 spent the night with him and visited him twice or thrice

thereafter. He disclosed that A-1 used to feel sad / sentimental due to

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 68 of 201
 imprisonment of Baba. Elaborating his visit along with A-3 and PW-

Vikram on March 19, 1975 at around 07.30 or 08.00 P.M., he deposed

that A-3 and PW-Vikram with whom he was familiar before had secret

conversation on the terrace for about half an hour. A-1 informed him that

it was not possible to secure Baba‟s release through constitutional means

and no other course was left except to shake the Government for release

of Baba even at the cost of his own life. He further deposed that on March

20, 1975 at around 05.00 A.M., A-1, A-3 and PW-Vikram got up and after

taking bath and break fast, they left the house at around 08.00 or 08.30

A.M., carrying a black bag with them. At about 05.30 P.M. when he

returned from his office, A-3 came in a distracted mood and was very

much nervous and perplexed. A-1 also arrived there at about 06.30 P.M.

Vikram did not come to him that night. The assertion of the witness about

stay of A-1 and A-3 along with Vikram on the night intervening

19/20.03.1975 at his residence remained unchallenged in the cross-

examination. No reasons were suggested by A-1 and A-3 for their stay at

PW-57‟s residence on the said night. It confirms their presence in Delhi

soon before the occurrence. In the absence of any infirmity, this Court has

no reasons to discard the version given by this witness who had no


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 69 of 201
 animosity with the appellants. The testimony of this witness is in tune

with that of PW-Vikram - approver.
(g)   Stay at Hostel in PG Guest House - A-1 & A-3's involvement

66.          Specific case of CBI was that at A-1‟s instance, PW-55 (Shiv

Raj Singh) had reserved a room for two days in PG Guest House of the

Pusa Institute in the fictitious name of „Pawan Kumar from Azamgarh‟

and that entry (Ex.PW-122/A) in PG Guest House register (Ex.P-122) was

made in this regard. While appearing as PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) a Ph.D.

student at the institute in 1975 gave narration as to how he came into

contact with A-1 through Sh. Kanwaldhari in 1972. A-1 was editor of the

„Prout‟ published from D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi and was

an „Awadhoot‟ wearing saffron clothes and supporting a beard and long

hair. He was regular visitor to Pusa Institute. He further deposed that he

acceded to A-1‟s request to let him stay in the hostel during his visits to

Delhi. On March 18 or 19, 1975 at A-1‟s request, he made reservation of a

room in the hostel for some Anand Margies who were expected to arrive

in the name of „Pawan Kumar from Azamgarh‟. Entry (Ex.PW-122/A) at

page 32 in the name of „Pawan Kumar‟ made on March 20, 1975 was in

his handwriting and contained his signatures at portion mark Q5A in

register (Ex.P-122). He further deposed that A-1 and A-3 had stayed in the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 70 of 201
 room reserved by him. The key of the room was collected by A-1 in the

evening of March 20, 1975 at around 05.30 P.M. A-1 and A-3 met him on

March 25 at about 06.00 A.M. after they had delivered the key of the

room to the chowkidar. In the cross-examination, he elaborated that he

had put his signatures on Ex.PW-122/A at Q5A in the morning of March

20, 1975, at the time of making reservation and payment of advance of

`2/-. He denied the suggestion that receipt for payment was issued to him

on March 22, 1975. He was fair enough to say that he did not personally

visit the room reserved by him. He denied the suggestion that the „guest‟

for whom the room was reserved had left it on March 22, at 05.00 P.M.

The appellants did not suggest the name of any such „guest‟ and purpose

of his visit. PW-55 was unaware as to who had made the rest of the entry

in Ex.PW-122/A. In further cross-examination, he informed that on

inquiry from A-1 as to who else was staying with him in the room on

March 20, 1975 at about 12‟o clock in the night A-1 named A-3. He

reasoned to provide accommodation to A-1 being fellow Anand Margi.

He was unaware if accommodation was used for A-3‟s stay also.

67.          On examination of the ocular testimony of this independent

public witness who was well acquainted with A-1 being fellow Anand

Margi, it is clear that he had no extraneous consideration to make a false
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 71 of 201
 statement regarding reservation of accommodation in PG Hostel for his

stay in the name of „Pawan Kumar from Azamgarh‟ as instructed by him.

The documentary evidence confirms his assertion. Register (Ex.P-122)

containing entry (Ex.PW-122/A) at Sl.No. 432 was seized after a

considerable period in July, 1975 by CBI. It contained number of various

entries with detailed particulars up to entries recorded at serial number

1028. Also receipt book (Ex.D-40) containing receipt at serial number

2584 in the name of „Pawan Kumar‟ pertaining to reservation of room

number 227 for ` 2/- was seized in July, 1975. It contained various entries

subsequent to it till entry 2600. Apparently, there was least possibility of

forging or fabricating these documents / entries maintained in the ordinary

course of business by an independent agency. The appellants examined

DW-1 (Ram Chander), a caretaker in PG Hostel from Pusa Institute in

defence. However, on the relevant date, he was on leave and had resumed

duties after the expiry of leave on March 24, 1975. Needless to say that

the entries, after his joining, were in his handwriting. The genuineness and

correctness of both register (Ex.P-122) containing entry (Ex.PW-122/A)

and receipt (Ex.D-40) were not questioned. Various doubts raised by

appellants‟ counsel during trial were out-rightly rejected in paras 184 to

189 with sound reasons in the impugned judgment. The appellants did not
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 72 of 201
 summon the relevant witness who had officiated in the absence of regular

caretaker on the relevant date. Para 189 records that Badrinarayan, the

Assistant Caretaker to whom Shiv Raj Singh had made the payment on

March 20, 1975 was summoned as a defence witness but he was not

examined despite his appearance in the Court on August 02, 1976. No

reasonable explanation has been offered for not examining the Assistant

Caretaker whose signatures finds mention on the receipt (Ex.D-40). There

is no substance in the appellants‟ plea that PW-55 cannot be trusted as the

form which was required to be filled for reservation was not produced

before the Court. Nothing has come on record if any form was filled up by

PW-55 at the time of getting the room reserved. DW-1 (Ram Chander)

informed that earlier a form was required to be filled by the concerned

student. Before January 1975, no such register as Ex.P-122 was being

maintained. The only record maintained at that time in the shape of forms.

After January 1975, the register as well as the form represented the record

for such reservation. It appears that PW-55 made entries in the register

(Ex.P-122) directly without filling the form. No such question was asked

from this witness if he had filled up any such „form‟. The necessity to fill

up the form was for the reason to incorporate the particulars subsequently

in the register (Ex.P-122). Since the witness had made entries directly in
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 73 of 201
 the register (Ex.P-122), there was no need to fill up the form particularly

when the concerned caretaker was not available. DW-1 (Ram Chander)

has admitted that whenever the form was not available, entries could be

made directly in the register. In his evidence, he disclosed that the form

relating to entry (Ex.PW-122/A) was delivered by him to Kuldeep Singh,

Sr.Technical Assistant, PG Hostel. However, no such form was seized by

the Investigating Officer Mr.Puri and he was not questioned in that regard.

Moreover, the appellants did not summon Kuldeep Singh to substantiate if

any such form was delivered to him. In fact, a specific suggestion was put

in the cross-examination that the witness had reserved the accommodation

for the „guest‟ who had left the hostel on March 22, 1975 in the evening.

This lends credence to the assertion of the witness about reservation of the

accommodation by making relevant entry in the register (Ex.P-122). The

prosecution has established beyond doubt that the accommodation was

reserved by PW-55 at the instance of A-1, and A-1 and A-3 stayed in the

said accommodation as the key of it was taken by A-1 from this witness in

the evening on March 20. It further establishes presence of A-1 and A-3 in

Delhi on these dates. No specific suggestion was put that A-1 had not

stayed in the accommodation reserved by this witness. It was within the

special knowledge of A-1 and A-3 as to why and for what purpose they
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 74 of 201
 had stayed in the said accommodation in the name of non-existant person

„Pawan Kumar from Azamgarh‟ or during which period to which period

they stayed in the said accommodation and where else they went after

vacating it. All these facts have not been divulged by A-1 or A-3.

Reservation of accommodation in the assumed name for stay during the

relevant period and complete denial about it is an incriminating

circumstance showing their unreasonable conduct during crucial period

when the occurrence took place.
(h)          Purchase of new chappals - By A-3 on 20.03.1975

68.          Another circumstance which prominently sheds light on the

involvement of A-3 relates to the discovery of factum of purchase of new

pair of „hawai‟ chappals by him soon after the incident as well as

identification of the shop from where the chappals were purchased.

69.          As in any crime, criminals leave some foot prints, chappals

(Ex.A1 & Ex.A2) whose photographs (Ex.PW-107 to Ex.PW-119) taken

by police photographer - Khayali Ram (PW-47) discarded by the assailant

were seized at the spot by PW-Inp.Sajjan Singh soon after the incident by

a seizure memo (Ex.P-17). During investigation, these chappals were

found to be that of A-3. PW-1 (Vikram) deposed that these were the same

„hawai‟ chappals which were discarded by A-3 while fleeing the spot on
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 75 of 201
 the right side of the car. He further deposed that A-3 had worn these

chappals on the day of occurrence while leaving PW- Raj Singh‟s

residence in the morning. No suggestion was put by A-3 to disown

chappals (Ex.A-1 and Ex.A-2) or that he did not wear them at that time.

PW-2 (Jai Chand), an independent witness, having no animus, identified

A-3 to be the assailant who discarded the chappals on the right hand side

of the car at some distance and which were seized after preparing sketches

Ex.P18 and Ex.P19 bearing his signatures. PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia)‟s

statement that A-3 was wearing blue shirt, biscuit colour pants and

chappals on the day of occurrence and he had seen him running bare foot

after the incident when he came to the taxi and opened the door remained

unchallenged in the cross-examination. PW-5 (Charan Singh), taxi driver,

corroborated his version and stated that he had seen A-3 running bare

foot. Similar is the testimony of PW-6 (Inder Singh) who deposed that

when he came out of the car, he saw chappals of the fleeing man lying at a

distance of 3 or 4 yards on the right hand side of the car. PW-41 (HC

Surenderpal Singh), on duty at gate „A‟ at Supreme Court on March 20,

1975 informed the Control Room and SHO PS Tilak Nagar about the

incident between 04.15 P.M. and 04.30 P.M. and disclosed about

„chappals‟ lying near the car. PW-17 (SI Inder Singh) recorded message in
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 76 of 201
 the prescribed form (Ex.P-45). The factum of chappals lying at the spot

finds mention in Ex.P-45. There is specific mention about it in the FIR

too. From the testimonies of all these witnesses, it stands established that

while leaving PW-Raj Singh‟s residence for the mission on 20.03.1975,

A-3 had worn chappals (Ex.A-1 and Ex.A-2) and these were discarded by

him soon after the crime while fleeing bare foot from the spot apparently

to escape fastly. This Court finds that it was not suggested even remotely

to PWs that A-3 was not wearing these chappals or the same were planted

subsequently. PW-Insp. Sajjan Singh had no occasion to plant these

chappals on the day of occurrence itself as none of the appellants was a

suspect. There are no allegations against Delhi police for concocting a

false story against the appellants. PW-38 (P.S.Nayar), Senior Scientific

Officer, Incharge Finger Print Section, Central Forensic Science

Laboratory, R.K.Puram, New Delhi, received chappals (Ex.A-1 and Ex.A-

2) on March 22, 1975 and prepared their photographs (Ex.P90 & Ex.P91)

on March 24, 1975. The Trial Court examined the chappals (Ex.A-1 and

Ex.A-2), photographs (Ex.P90 & Ex.P91) and the photographic

transparencies of the footprints (Ex.P88 and Ex.P89) and was of the

opinion that these (Ex.A-1 and Ex.A-2) were the chappals which A-3 was

wearing and had abandoned at the spot.

 70.          During police custody remand on August 13, 1975. A-3 in

disclosure statement (Ex.P101) disclosed about purchase of new „hawai‟

chappals on March 20, 1975 evening from a shop in NDSC Part-I near a

bank in New Delhi. A-3 led the police team to the shop being run under

the name of M/s. Fair Deal, G-24, NDSC Part-I, New Delhi. In 313

statement, A-3 admitted about his visit to „Fair Deal‟ Shop in South

Extension. PW-42 (B.L.Kumar), UDC in the office of Superintendent

Surveyor of Work Aviation, CPWD, R.K.Puram, was associated in the

investigation and disclosure statement of A-3 (Ex.P-101) was recorded in

his presence. He deposed that after that they all including A-3 went to

South Extension and A-3 pointed out the shop from where he had

purchased the chappals; the name of said shop was „Fair Deal‟. The

pointing out memo Ex.P-102 was prepared and A-3 wrote Ex.P-102/A

there in his own hand and signatures. Cash memo book Ex.P-103 was

seized vide memo Ex.P-104. His testimony remained unchallenged in

cross-examination. Nothing was suggested if A-3 was threatened or forced

to make the disclosure statement. This official witness had no ulterior

motive to falsely implicate A-3.
             The Trial Court for valid reasons rejected the documents

(Ex.P101 and Ex.P102) being inadmissible under Section 27 of the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 78 of 201
Evidence Act. However, it concluded that the new chappals purchased by

A-3 from the said shop coupled with other circumstances and oral

evidence was certainly a link in the chain of circumstantial evidence

against him.
71.            PW-53 (Shiv Charan), salesman, Fair Deal, South Ext. Part-I

deposed that in August 1975, A-3 was brought by CBI at his shop.

Identifying A-3, he recalled that he had come to the shop bare foot about 3

or 4 months prior to the said date and had purchased „hawai‟ chappals

from their shop at about 05.30 or 05.45 P.M. on March 20, 1975. After

seeing cash memo book (Ex.P103), cash memo (Ex.P103/A) bearing

serial number 2377 therein, he identified his signatures thereon. He

deposed that cash for sale of „chappals‟ was received by the proprietor and

the cash memo was prepared by him. He had sold „hawai‟ chappals to him

because the only item in their shop carrying a price of   ` 7.95 was the

„hawai chappals‟. Nothing was suggested to him that A-3 had not visited

the shop to purchase „hawai‟ chappals. PW-54 (Wazir Chand), partner in

M/s.Fair Deal, also supported him and deposed that the police had seized

cash memo book (Ex.P103) from their shop vide memo (Ex.P104) on

August 13, 1975. His son Vijay Kumar had put his signatures also in his

presence on that. He identified A-3 who was brought by the police at his
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 79 of 201
 shop in custody. He identified his signatures on Ex.P102 and Ex.P104. He

disclosed that cash memo book (Ex.P-103) was maintained in the regular

course of business. He denied the suggestion in that Ex.P102 had already

been written out by the police before arrival in the shop. Both these

witnesses had no animosity with A-3 to falsely recognize him as the

customer who had purchased new „hawai‟ chappals from their shop.

These chappals were not subject matter of the crime and were not a case

property as such.
72.          The circumstance of purchase of new chappals at about 05.30

or 05.45 P.M. from the shop at NDSC Part-I by A-3 lends credence to the

testimony of PWs-1, 2, 4, 5 & 6 that soon after the occurrence, A-3 had

fled the spot bare foot after discarding chappals at the spot. CBI was not

aware of the existence of the shop in question prior to the recording of the

A-3‟s disclosure statement (Ex.P101). They were not aware if A-3 had

purchased new chappals from the shop on the day of incident. All these

facts came into their knowledge pursuant to A-3‟s disclosure statement

when he led them to the said shop where the sales man and the owner of

the shop identified him as the customer who had purchased new „hawai‟

chappals from their shop. A-3 did not controvert these facts. He did not

explain as to what had prompted him to urgently purchase new chappals
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 80 of 201
 from PW-53 on March 20, 1975. He did not explain as to why he was

forced to visit the said shop bare foot. All these facts were within A-3‟s

special knowledge which he failed to explain / divulge. Under Section

106 Evidence Act, an adverse inference is to be drawn against him for not

explaining them.
73.          Purchase of new chappals on March 20, 1975 after PW-1 and

other witnesses had seen him running barefoot after discarding chappals is

an incriminating circumstance to connect A-3 with the crime and to

establish his presence at the place of incident at the time of throwing of

the hand-grenades. The factum of purchase of chappals reflects the post-

event conduct of A-3 and is relevant under Section 8 of the Evidence Act.

74.          The Trial Court accepted the opinion given by PW-38

(P.S.Nayar), Senior Scientific Officer, Incharge Finger Print Section,

CFSL, R.K.Puram, New Delhi. PW-38 (P.S.Nayar) had examined

chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2), their photographs (Ex.P90 and Ex.P91) and

photographic transparencies of footprints (Ex.P98 and Ex.P99), and was

of the opinion that the impressions of the five toes and the ball of the feet

on the chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2) could have been formed by the feet of

A-3. He also conducted the experiment by asking A-3 to wear the

chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2). He testified that as a result of the said
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 81 of 201
 experiment, the marks made on the chappals (Ex.A1 and Ex.A2) exactly

coincided with A-3‟s five toes, the ball of his feet and the sole of feet on

both the chappals.
75.          I am in agreement with the appellants‟ contention that the

science of identification of foot print is not a fully developed science and

no reliance can be placed upon it to base conviction. However, it is also

true that the report of the expert can be taken as an additional link to

corroborate the other clinching evidence on record. In the case of

„Mohd.Aman, Babu Khan and Anr. vs. State of Rajasthan‟ in

Crl.A.No.1749 with Crl.A.No.1833/1996 decided by the Supreme Court

on 08.05.1997, it was held :
             The significance of the evidence of these witnesses is that

Investigation Officer succeeded in discovering the shop of PW-Wazir

Chand on the pointing out of A-3.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 82 of 201
 (i)          Preparation of Drafts (Ex.P10 to P14) and dispatch to
             newspapers & Supreme Court - by A-1

76.          To link A-1 with the crime, the prosecution has relied upon

documents (Ex.P10 to P14). The criticism against these documents are

various and varied. Attempt has been made by A-1 to disown the

documents.
77.          PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) deposed that on March 20, 1975 at

around 09.00 P.M., A-1 came and at his instance, he called PW- Ranbir

Singh to his room. Giving a draft written in Hindi, A-1 asked them to

prepare its copies. Since the draft contained objectionable material, they

showed reluctance to prepare its copies. It agitated A-1 and he extended a

threat. Thereafter, they prepared the copies in Hindi and delivered these to

A-1. On seeing their handwriting, A-1 remarked that Ranbir‟s writing was

not in order. The copies were prepared of the „draft‟ which carried the

caption ""Akhal Bhartiya Sashatra Viplvi Chhater/ Yuva Singh"". Ex.P10

consisted of two sheets which was in his hand and he had prepared this

copy from the manuscript prepared by A-1. The draft prepared by A-1 did

not have any date and the copies therefore, prepared by him also did not

contain any date. The witness further deposed that again, on March 21,

1975 in the evening, A-1 came and gave him a „draft‟ to prepare its
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 83 of 201
 copies. That was a letter addressed to Chief Justice, Sh.Ray and contained

the same caption. He prepared seven or eight copies of that letter and

delivered it to A-1. He had dated the copies as March 22, 1975 at A-1‟s

instance as he had told him that the copies would be mailed on March 22,

1975. A-1 had got written from him addresses on number of envelopes

including the one on which he had written the address of Sh.A.N.Ray,

Chief Justice of India. The other envelopes were addressed to the editors

etc., of the newspapers. Ex.P11, Ex.P12, Ex.P13, Ex.P14 and Ex.P14/A

were the envelopes which were all in his hand. The witness further

deposed that A-1 had read each and every copy prepared by him and had

made „corrections‟ in them. In Ex.P11, A-1 had made the corrections and

written the word ""mend"" at Q18/A. ""Rule of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, it must

not subjugate its"" at Q3A in Ex.P12. This line had to be added by him

because he had omitted to copy it out from the original „draft‟. Similarly,

in Ex.P13 and Ex.P14, he had made corrections and written the word

""mend"" at Q4A and Q1A, respectively. The witness explained that on

March 20 when he had prepared the Hindi draft, A-1 had also made

corrections and added the words ""Damit"" and ""Soshit"" marked Q19A, and

the word ""Purn"" marked Q19A. A-1 again visited him on March 22,

evening. He came up with another Hindi draft and got the copies of that
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 84 of 201
 draft prepared from him. The draft also carried the same caption as

mentioned earlier. In the cross-examination, the witness fairly admitted

that these letters, etc. were not mailed to his knowledge. A-1 had made the

correction of a word ""mend"" in two or three copies only and not in all

copies. He wrote the word ""mend"" in the rest of the copies in his own

hand writing. He disclosed that after March 20, 1975, PW-Ranbir Singh

had met him twice and thrice and they had discussed about the preparation

of the copies of the draft and considered the risk involved in it and

decided not to do any such thing in future. He admitted that there was no

mention of A-1‟s name in the contents of the letter. The code words used

in the letter were not known to him. He denied the suggestion that Ex.P10

to Ex.P14A were his handiwork and he falsely named A-1 to save his

skin.
78.          In the cross-examination (conducted by Sh. K.L.Sharma,

Advocate), the witness stated that it was for the first time that he had

heard or read the caption ""Akhil Bhartiya Shashaster Viplavi Chhatar

Yuva Sangh"" on March 20, 1975. On scanning the testimony as a whole,

it transpires that A-1 did not challenge his visits to PW-55 (Shiv Raj

Singh) on March 20 and 21, 1975 to get prepare copies of the draft from

him. No suggestion was put to the witness that no such corrections in
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 85 of 201
 Ex.P11, Ex.P12, Ex.P13 & Ex.P14 were made by him (A-1) in his own

hand writing or that these were forged or fabricated documents. PW-44

(Ranbir Singh) has corroborated PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) on all material

facts in this regard. He deposed that on being threatened by A-1, they

agreed to do his bidding and prepared three or four copies in Hindi. In the

cross-examination, he elaborated that he had enquired from A-1 as to what

he would do with the copies of the draft. A-1‟s reply to him was to carry

on with the job of copying instead of wasting time in making such

enquiries. He admitted the suggestion, ""It is correct that Shiv Raj Singh

and he were busy in preparing the copies simultaneously"". He admitted

that he did not read the English draft. He further deposed that A-1 had

explained at the spot that the draft would be published in the name of

""Akhil Bharatiya Sashstar Viplvi Chhatter Yuva Sangh"" so that nobody

would come to know who had published it. Again, nothing material

emerged in the cross-examination to discard his version. A-1 did not deny

that the amendments in question were not made by him in his

handwriting.
79.            PW-57 (Raj Singh) supplemented the version given by PW-

54 and PW-55, and deposed that on March 22, 1975 at about 08.30 A.M.,

A-1 came to him and intended to accompany him to post certain letters at
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 86 of 201
 Kashmiri Gate on the way to his office. When he offered to post the letters

for him, A-1 delivered to him a packet wrapped in a piece of paper

containing postal envelopes. The witness further deposed that at GPO,

Kashmiri Gate when he opened the wrapper, he found that the very first

envelope contained the address of Sh.A.N.Ray, CJI. He was unnerved on

seeing it and could not pluck courage to see the other envelopes. He

mailed all the letters into the mail box. He identified the envelope (Ex.P-

14A) addressed to Sh.A.N.Ray. In the cross-examination, nothing material

could be extracted on this aspect and no suggestion was put that no such

envelope was handed over by A-1 to him or it was not mailed by him.

Contrary to that a suggestion was put ""I deny the suggestion that I was

myself a party to the conspiracy and that I mailed the letters because that

was the job assigned to me"". This suggestion clinches the issue. These

letters were subsequently, received in the offices of various newspapers.

A-1 did not offer any explanation as to for what purpose, the drafts were

prepared and dispatched to the offices of various newspapers and also to

CJI. PW-50 S.K.Gupta, PW-51 V.G.Verghese (The Hindustan Times),

PW-52 Abdul Rehman (The Indian Express) and PW-58 B.K.Joshi (The

Times of India) have confirmed this version.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 87 of 201
 80.          PW-8 (Ujjawal Prakash) joined the „Organisation‟ in 1957.

He joined services of Tata but resigned in 1966 at the instance of his Guru

Anand Murti. He held various important positions in the „Organisation‟.

In 1970, he came to work as Office Secretary in Delhi in the newly

opened office of PBI at 13, Ferozshah Road. In his deposition, he claimed

that A-1 was known to him since long and they had regular visiting terms

in 1970. A-1 was working as editor of the „Prout‟ published from D-41,

South Extension Part-I, New Delhi and he used to meet him frequently at

13, Ferozshah Road and D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi. He

claimed that he was quite familiar with the handwriting of A-1 both in

Hindi and English. He identified A-1‟s handwriting on Ex.P10 (marked

Q19A); Ex.P11 (marked Q18A); document Ex.P12 (marked Q3A);

Ex.P13 (marked Q4A), Ex.P14 (marked Q1A). He further identified

document (Ex.P15) and stated that this document in its entirety was in the

handwriting of A-1. He also recognized that in Ex.P22 the writing marked

A1 to A72 were in the handwriting of A-1. In the cross-examination, he

denied that he, Vikram and Naval agreed to become witnesses in the

present case as a part of conspiracy with others including Madhvanand

and Krishnanand. No suggestion was put to the witness that A-1 had no

close association with him or that he was not familiar with his
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 88 of 201
 handwriting. No suggestion was put that the handwriting on the

questioned documents were not that of A-1. Since this witness had worked

with A-1 in Delhi in the same „Organisation‟ and was acquainted with him

since long, his testimony regarding identification of his handwriting on

the questioned documents cannot be doubted. Similar is the testimony of

PW-49 (Sudhir Kumar Basedar) who joined the „Organisation‟ in 1962

and was made an „Avadhoot‟ in 1965. He deposed that in 1968 or 1969 he

brought Vikram from Ranchi to Delhi and was in close contact with A-1

and Vikram. He was incharge of D-41, South Extension, New Delhi. A-1

was working as an editor of „Prout‟ under him. He claimed that he had

seen A-1 writing and signing and was familiar with his handwriting and

signatures. He also identified handwriting on Ex.P10 to Ex.P15 at

questioned portions to be that of A-1. He also identified exercise book

Ex.P22 and writings marked A-1 to A-72 therein both in English and

Hindi and testified that these too were in A-1‟s handwriting. In the cross-

examination, he denied          the   suggestion   that   after   leaving   the

„Organisation‟, he became a regular informer and tout of the police. A-1,

Vikram, Nitesh Kumar, Gundadhishanand, etc. used to reside at D-41,

South Extension. Bank account was also in A-1‟s name. He saw his

writings many a times and used to receive letters from A-1. No suggestion
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                     Page 89 of 201
 was put to the witness that he was not acquainted with the handwriting

and signatures of A-1 or that the handwriting on the questioned

documents were not that of A-1.
81.          PW-1 (Vikram) who had long association with A-1 identified

his signatures on Ex.P10 to Ex.P15. He deposed that he was familiar with

the handwriting and signatures of A-1 and had seen him writing and

signing umpteen times at D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi when

he had been editing the papers there both in Hindi and English. The entire

contents of the document Ex.P15 were in A-1‟s handwriting. The

statement has remained unchallenged in the cross-examination.

82.          The Trial Judge in para (343) of the impugned judgment

himself examined the disputed corrections marked Q19A, Q18A, Q3A,

Q4A and Q1A with the standard and specimen writings of A-1 and also

with his writing in the application Ex.P2 and was of the considered

opinion that all the disputed corrections were authored by A-1.

83.          The Trial Court relied upon the testimony of handwriting

expert PW-48 (B.Lal), who gave definite opinion that the disputed

corrections marked Q19A in Ex.P10 and marked Q3A in Ex.P12 were

authored by the same person (A-1) who wrote the specimen / standard

writings. The Trial Court relied upon the opinion of the handwriting
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 90 of 201
 expert as per the law existing at the time of delivery of the judgment.

Even if, report of handwriting expert is excluded in view of recent

judgment    of   this   Court   „Sapan    Haldar    &   Anr.    vs.   State‟,

Crl.A.No.804/2001 decided on 25.05.2012, it would not dilute the

conclusion arrived at by the Trial Court about A-1 to be the author of the

questioned hand-writing in view of positive and cogent evidence given by

PWs-Vikram, Ujjawal Prakash and Sudhir Kumar Basedar who were well

conversant and familiar with his handwriting. Moreover, the trial Court

itself had examined the questioned and specimen handwriting to arrive at

the said conclusion. Discretion lies with the Court to form an opinion inter

alia as to the identity of the handwriting and in so doing, it is always

permissible for the Court to compare on its own.
84.          From the testimonies of witnesses, it reveals that A-1 had

drafted the original Hindi manuscript of which he caused a copy (Ex.P10)

to be prepared by Shiv Raj Singh on March 20, 1975. He made the

corrections marked Q19A in his own handwriting that very night. On

March 21, 1975, he got prepared the copies (Ex.P11 to Ex.P14A) of an

open letter addressed to the CJI prepared from Shiv Raj Singh and made

the corrections marked Q18A, Q3A, Q4A and Q1A in those documents in

his own hand. A-1 did not offer any explanation as to why and under what
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 91 of 201
 circumstances, his handwriting appeared on these questioned documents

which contained objectionable material. He also failed to explain the

purpose of preparing these inflammatory documents soon after the

incident. These documents also confirm his presence in Delhi on these

dates. Apparently, these documents are incriminating in nature and point

an accusing finger at A-1 showing his participation in the crime.

85.          The prosecution examined PW-51 (B.G.Verghese), Editor of

The Hindustan Times in March, 1975 who deposed that the letter Ex.P13

received in their office was forwarded by him to Sh.N.K.Mukherjee,

Home Secretary, Govt. of India vide covering letter Ex.P80. PW-52

(Abdul Rahman), Chief Reporter, The Indian Express, in March 1975

deposed that document Ex.P10 consisting of two sheets was received in

their office on March 22, 1975. A news item (Ex.P131) was developed

and published in „The Indian Express‟ on March 24, 1975. Ex.P132 was

published in „The Times of India‟. PW-50 (S.K.Gupta), Registrar,

Supreme Court of India, in March 1975 deposed that envelope (Ex.P14/A)

was received by him from the Principal Private Secretary to Chief Justice

of India. The document (Ex.P14) was in that envelope at that time and the

envelope contained the address of CJI. The envelope along with its

contents was passed on to him either on April 01 or 02, 1975. He
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 92 of 201
 forwarded Ex.P14 with the envelope to Sh. P.N.Mehra, S.P.Security along

with other documents. Apparently, A-1 not only prepared the documents

(Ex.P10 to Ex.P14A) but also sent / mailed these to various newspapers

and to the Chief Justice of India at Supreme Court. The open letter

addressed to the Chief Justice of India was mailed after the unsuccessful

attempt on his life to intimidate him.
(j)          Performance of journey by A-1 & A-3 on 25.03.1975

86.          After analyzing the evidence of various witnesses including

DSP B.R.Puri (PW-71), Sardari Lal (PW-21), Harbhagwan (PW-9),

Vishnu Datt Sharma (PW-10), B.R.Bakshi (PW-11), Jit Singh (PW-12),

Prem Prakash Sharma (PW-25), and the documents Ex.P-23 to Ex.P-27,

Ex.P-57, Ex.P-58, Ex.P-77, Ex.P-78 and Ex.P-127 minutely, the Trial

Court concluded that A-2 admittedly wrote Ex.P-23 and Ex.P-25 and that

thereby, he made reservation of a berth in a three-tier sleeper coach in the

name of „Pankaj Kumar‟ on March 15, 1975 and of a seat in the sitting

compartment in the name of „Ramesh Kumar‟ on March 21, 1975 for

journey by 2-Down, Kalka- Howrah Mail which departed from Delhi

Main on March 25, 1975. It also relied upon the testimonies of PW-24

(Ram Prakash Babbar), PW-23 (Bhagat Ram Ahuja), PW-31 (P.S.Yadav),

PW-32 (Hari Singh) and PW-40 (Surjeet Singh Ahluwalia) to conclude
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 93 of 201
 that A-2 made use of two different names and addresses (of Pankaj Kumar

and Ramesh Kumar) which were fictitious and non-existant. Under the

heading „Solution of the Riddle of Fictitious Names‟, relying on the oral

and documentary evidence, the Trial Court found that A-1 and A-3 were

the individuals who performed the actual journey on the strength of

reservation (Ex.P-23 and Ex.P-25) in the said train. During arguments, A-

2 did not categorically deny and controvert the incriminating circumstance

proved against him in this regard. In his written submissions, he urged that

these tickets reserved in the fictitious names for A-1 and A-3 did not

further the alleged conspiracy which was hatched, implemented and

finished on March 20, 1975 itself. At the relevant time, A-1 was an

accused in a self-immolation case of Acharya Dhineshwaranand of which

he and his co-accused were later acquitted. A-2 being lawyer for the

followers of the „Organisation‟ at that time had defended A-1 in that case.

He further urged that from the contents of the diary (Ex.P-137) containing

an unsigned letter (Ex.P-4), seized from his house, it is apparent that A-1

did not communicate directly with him but acted through a „parokar‟. In

order to avoid arrest in the self-immolation case in which A-1 was

absconding, he (A-1) or his „parokar‟ simply wanted to obtain train tickets

on his behalf in some fictitious name for his usual travel and requested
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 94 of 201
 him (A-2) to book them. This explanation is wholly reasonable, as

reservation for train tickets did nothing whatsoever to assist or advance

the cause of conspiracy executed on March 20, 1975. Apparently, A-2 half

heartedly denied the reservation made vide Ex.P-23 and Ex.P-25. The

prosecution was able to bring on record overwhelming evidence to prove

that A-1 and A-3 travelled on that day in the said train on the strength of

these tickets.
87.          Crucial testimony in this regard is that of PW-56 (Suresh

Chand Samanta) who was unacquainted with the appellants prior to the

incident and did not nurture any ill-will or grievance to falsely implicate

them. Being an Assistant Director, Tourist office, Government of India at

Calcutta, he visited Delhi to appear in an interview before UPSC on

March 24, 1975 for the post of Director of Tourism. Being a responsible

officer he was not expected to make a false declaration. He deposed that

on March 25,1975, he left Delhi for Calcutta by Kalka-Howrah Mail at

08.00 A.M. He identified A-1 unerringly to be his co-passenger in the said

train who occupied the lower berth and with whom he had conversation in

English on tourism during day time. He further disclosed that A-1 did not

have beard that time and perhaps was wearing bushirt and pants. Another

passenger Ramesh travelling in the said compartment who was going to
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 95 of 201
 Calcutta to see his mother had also conversed with him. He came from

Calcutta to Delhi on July 29, 1975 or so, to identify A-1 at Tihar jail. In

the cross-examination, the witness answered all the queries of the

appellants‟ counsel about his visit to Delhi. He disclosed that during

journey both, he and A-1 had taken food together; lunch was also shared

by them. He became very friendly with A-1 on the way and had given his

visiting card to him. A-1 was wearing a hearing-aid at that time. He

denied the suggestion that A-1‟s photograph was shown to him and on the

strength of that photograph, he identified him in the Court of Sh.Oberoi.

Scanning the testimony of this witness reveals that despite thorough cross-

examination, his testimony could not be shattered. The witness who had

no prior animosity with A-1 was not expected to give false statement

being a responsible officer. The prosecution was able to produce evidence

on record that this witness actually travelled in the train on that day. It is

not unusual for the passengers to become familiar with each other during

long journey and develop some intimacy. Since the witness had spent long

time with A-1 during the journey and had direct conversation with him, he

had sufficient, reasonable and fair opportunity to note and observe the

broad features to recognize him at a subsequent date. CBI was able to

reach to this witness after scanning the reservation chart prepared for that
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 96 of 201
 day. This witness not only identified A-1 but also willingly agreed to

participate in the TIP which the appellant declined to join. In his Court

statement, this witness had no hesitation to recognize and identify A-1.

There are no valid reasons to discard the cogent, reliable and un-

impeachable statement of this independent public witness. This witness

was fair enough not to implicate A-3.
88.          PW-30 (Ramesh Kumar Bagdi), a clerk working with

Ambica Trade Corporation at G.B.Road, Delhi, supported and

corroborated the version given by PW-56 (Suresh Chand Samanta) about

their journey in Kalka-Howrah Mail on March 25, 1975. He deposed that

on that day, he was allotted berth in the three tier sleeper vide requisition

slip Ex.P-57 and he travelled by Kalka-Howrah Mail, Delhi. He identified

A-1 having a hearing aid in his ears to be co-passenger on the lower berth

on his right side. He recalled that A-1 had played mouth organ. He

travelled with him right upto Howrah. He also recognized A-3 to be the

„passenger‟ who often used to visit A-1 during the journey at different

stations. He identified A-1 with certainty as he had long conversation with

him. He was not very sure to identify A-3 to be the „passenger‟ who used

to visit A-1. Putting his finger on A-3, he stated that „perhaps‟ he was the

person who had been visiting A-1 in the compartment. This independent
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 97 of 201
 witness had no reasons to make false statement. Discrepancies in his

statement about visit of Insp. R.N.Tiwari to him in June, 1975 were dealt

with cogent reasons by the Trial Court. It came to the conclusion after

minute discussion that PW-30 was a truthful witness though a simple

person. The Trial Court came to conclude that Mr.Tiwari had visited him

only on July 20, 1975 when his statement was recorded. There are no

sound reasons to disbelieve the witness as CBI was able to trace him on

the strength of requisition slip (Ex.P-57) which contained his address. He

was not a witness to the incident and was not acquainted with A-1 or A-3

before. He specifically gave distinctive features of A-1 whereby he used

to play mouth organ in the compartment and had a hearing-aid. A-3

though not identified with „certainty‟ was disclosed to be the „possible‟

passenger who at a halting station had missed to alight. Despite minor

discrepancies as to when his statement was recorded or if photo of A-1

was shown to him, his evidence inspires confidence. The fact that he did

not identify A-3 with „certainty‟ and admitted that photo of A-1 was

shown to him prior to Test Identification Proceedings shows that he did

not conceal any fact.
89.          Ocular testimonies of both PW-30 and PW-56, co-passengers

coupled with depositions of official witnesses Gurmukh Singh (PW-28),
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 98 of 201
 Nand Lal Dass (PW-61), Sewa Ram (PW-29), K.B.Mishra (PW-62),

A.K.Sharma (PW-67) and Kishan Lal (PW-68), establish beyond doubt

that A-1 travelled on March 25, 1975 from Delhi to Howrah. It belies his

assertion that he was not present in Delhi before March 25, 1975. No

explanation was offered as to what was the purpose of his visit to Delhi.

The facts as to when he (A-1) visited Delhi; where he stayed before his

departure on March 25, 1975; how and by whom the tickets were reserved

in the fictitious names, etc. were all within his special knowledge and to

some extent, A-3‟s knowledge. However, none of them gave plausible

explanation to the incriminating circumstances. Under Section 106

Evidence Act, adverse inference is to be drawn against them. They cannot

get away by simply keeping quiet and offering no explanation on the

supposed premise that the burden to establish its case lies entirely upon

the prosecution. Unnatural conduct of the appellant (A-1) to travel in a

fictitious name out of Delhi soon after the occurrence is an incriminating

circumstance to connect him with the crime.
(k)          Testimony of PW-1 Vikram - The approver

90.          The central evidence in the case consists of the testimony of

PW-Vikram who turned approver and narrated the essential details of the


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 99 of 201
 prosecution case and the manner in which the appellants hatched the

conspiracy and executed it on March 20, 1975.
 At the outset, learned counsel for A-3 strenuously urged that

it would be inappropriate for this Court to rely on PW-1‟s testimony in

view of the specific directions by Supreme Court in Crl.A.No. 174/12

(arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 6489/06) decided on 19th January, 2012. He

urged that the Supreme Court doubted / suspected the truthfulness,

honesty and reliability of Vikram‟s statement in view of two diametrically

opposite statements; one made before CBI; and, the other before CID in

Danapur jail on 30.09.1978. The Supreme Court was of the view that one

of the statements of Vikram was false. Since it was very difficult to say at

that stage which of the statements was true and which of the statements

was made under the influence, threat or coercion by the State officers or

CBI, PW- Vikram was directed to be recalled for further examination.

Counsel further urged that it is a case in which CBI has deliberately kept

back the witness and has not deliberately produced him for cross-

examination. Vikram‟s statement before Trial Court requires to be

excluded from consideration while disposing of the appeal on merits. PW-

Vikram was the corner-stone of the prosecution case and that the entire

edifice virtually crumbled down in the absence of his evidence. Counsel

 relied upon various judgments, „Director of Settlements, Andhra Pradesh

& ors. vs. M.R.Apparao & anr.‟, 2002 (4) SCC 638; „Commissioner of

of the Constitution of India, the law laid down by Supreme Court is bound

to be followed in letter and spirit. This Court cannot deviate from the

observations made in the order dated 19.01.2012. It was further contended

that CBI was hand in glove with Vikram from the very inception. They

did not oppose grant of bail to him. Vikram did not furnish correct address

and produced fake sureties whose credientials were not verified by CBI.

He violated the bond condition not to leave Delhi till trial in L.N.Mishra

case was over. Learned Counsel for CBI urged that all sincere efforts were

made to find out the whereabouts of Vikram but he could not be traced at

his last known address and the address given in the bail bonds furnished

before the Court. It is even not clear whether he is „dead‟ or „alive‟ as he

has not been heard or seen after his release by any of his relatives. Under
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 101 of 201
Section 33 Evidence Act, Vikram‟s statement is required to be read for

consideration.
91.          It is a matter of record that Crl.M.No. 5700/98 was filed on

September 16, 1998 by the appellants to summon Vikram, the approver,

for further cross-examination in terms of Section 145 of the Evidence Act.

The said application was disposed of by this Court by an order dated

November 22, 2006. The appellants challenged the order in Supreme

Court. After considering the relevant contentions and observing that

Vikram had made diametrically opposite statements, and CBI and State

(CID) seemed to be at logger-heads with one accusing the other of

manipulating and using Vikram for its own designs and that one of the

statements of Vikram was false, the Supreme Court set aside that part of

the High Court order and directed it to summon Vikram for his further

examination with reference to his statement made in Danapur jail on

30.09.1978 by the appellants and if so desired by the CBI. It further

reveals that CBI was directed to furnish on record the latest address of the

witness Vikram to summon him for cross-examination. Various status

reports have been placed on record by CBI on different dates. Efforts were

made to find out Vikram at the address given in the bail bond furnished by

him in the Court of Sh.V.B.Bansal, the then learned Addl. Sessions Judge,
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 102 of 201
 New Delhi, on 28.11.1985. Attempts were made to reach to surety

Chander Prakash at 2433, Jahangirpuri, Delhi and at his office address in

Usha Electricals at R-2/1, Jindapur Road, Uttam Nagar. However, neither

Vikram nor Chander Prakash were found available at the addresses given

at Delhi. CBI again visited village Tirar, Tehsil Sanhola, District

Bhagalpur, Vikram‟s native place. Status report reveals that CBI officials

met Vikram‟s elder brother Parmanand Dass but he was not aware of his

whereabouts since his detention in Danapur jail, Patna. His elder brother

and two sisters were found to have expired. Two sisters Kaushalya Devi

and Priya Devi who lived in their matrimonial home in Jagdishpur village

were also found dead. CBI officials met Mahender Harijan, Kaushalya

Devi‟s son who gave the said information. He also was not aware of

Vikram for the last about 40 years. It further reveals that CBI published

the information in newspapers, the photocopies of which have been placed

on record calling upon the public in general to inform it about Vikram‟s

whereabouts. The concerned responsible CBI Officers have furnished

affidavits with regard to the efforts made to find out Vikram.

             The appellants have also not produced on record any

document to show if after his release in 1985, Vikram lived at a particular

address or place. There is nothing to infer that CBI deliberately and
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 103 of 201
 intentionally withheld Vikram for cross-examination. Vikram after his

arrest on July 24, 1975, continuously remained in custody till his release

on bail in 1985. Prior to his arrest, he was attached to the „Organisation‟

and had no private accommodation to live in. He abandoned his native

place at the age of about 14 or 15 years. A long period has since elapsed

after his release in 1985. It is not the case of the appellants that during this

period Vikram was seen or heard at any specific place. It is not clear

whether he is „alive‟. Various reports placed on record demonstrate that

sincere and reasonable efforts were put by CBI to ensure / procure his

presence before the Court. Adverse inference cannot be drawn against

CBI for withholding the witness deliberately. There is nothing on record

to show that CBI was hand in glove with Vikram and was instrumental in

his release. The proceedings in the instant case had already been

terminated long back in 1976 and Vikram had examined himself as a

witness / approver in L.N.Mishra case. This Court vide order dated

18.10.1985 granted bail to him in L.N.Misra case. It was for the Trial

Court to ensure that the surety bond furnished by Vikram was genuine and

sound. At no stage prior to moving of the application in 1998, the

appellants accused CBI of their connivance in the release of Vikram.


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 104 of 201
 92.          I have gone through the order dated 19.01.2012. In my view,

observations therein are confined only with respect to the limited question

of recalling the witness for re-examination. At no stage, the Supreme

Court judged the reliability or admissibility of Vikram‟s statements, one

before CBI in Delhi and the other before Danapur jail. Under Section 145

Cr.P.C. PW- Vikram was required to be examined to find out as to which

of the versions was correct. There are no observations / directions in the

order to exclude the statement made by Vikram before Trial Court

altogether in case of his non-availability. Apparently, recall of PW-1

(Vikram) for cross-examination was subjet to his availability. I find no

merit in the appellants‟ plea that Vikram‟s statement given before the

Court warrants outright rejection / exclusion due to CBI‟s inability to

produce him for cross-examination.
93.          Under Section 33 Evidence Act when it is wholly beyond the

power of a party to produce a witness on account of his death or

incapacity to give evidence or being kept out of the way by the other side

or when his presence cannot be obtained without unreasonable amount of

delay or expense or he cannot be found, his previous deposition is

admissible in a subsequent judicial proceeding in proof of the facts stated

therein, when all the following conditions are fulfilled : (1)       that   the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                    Page 105 of 201
 evidence was given in a judicial proceeding or before any person

authorized by law to take it; (2) that the first proceeding was between the

same parties as the second proceeding or between representatives in

interest of the parties to the second proceedings; (3)    that the party

against whom the deposition is tendered had a right and full opportunity

of cross-examining the deponent when the deposition was taken; (4)     that

the issues involved are the same or substantially the same in both

proceedings; (5)    that the winess is incapable of being called at the

subsequent proceedings (on account of death or incapability of giving

evidence or being kept out of the way by the other side or an unreasonable

amount or delay or expense or he cannot be found).
94.          In „Satnam Singh (Dead) by LRs. And Others vs. Sadhu Singh

and Others‟, JT 2001 (Suppl.1) SC 545, The Supreme Court held that

where the examination-in-chief of a witness has been completed but he

could not be put for cross-examination on account of his death, the

evidence of such witness cannot be rejected. Relevant para of the

judgment reads :

95.          This Court in „Krishan Dayal vs. Chandu Ram‟, 1969 ILR

(Delhi) 1090, held that the statement of a witness in examination-in-chief

which was admissible at the time it was recorded, cannot become

inadmissible by reason of the subsequent death of the witness before

cross-examination    and   the   absence of      cross-examination     would

undoubtedly affect the value and weight to be attached to the statement of

the witness, but it would not render the statement inadmissible or result in

its effacement and so far as the question is concerned as to what weight

should be attached to such statement made in examination-in-chief, the

Court has to keep in view the facts and circumstances of each individual

case.
96.          In „Turner Morrison and Co., Bombay vs. K.N.Tapuria and

others‟, 1993 Crl.L.J. 3384, PW-4 (Kashiprasad Kedia) had deposed

before the Trial Court prior to the framing of the charge but was not

available to the prosecution thereafter. When he was initially available to

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 107 of 201
 the Trial Court and his examination-in-chief was recorded, he was cross-

examined at great length on behalf of accused No.2, though accused No.1

declined to cross-examine him at that stage. The prosecution made

reasonable efforts to procure his presence but his whereabouts were

unknown. The evidence of the witness was considered admissible. It was

held that non-availability of the witness at a later stage of the same

proceeding will not render the evidence inadmissible since an opportunity

to cross-examine was afforded to the defence at the time when the witness

was examined.
97.          In „Jose vs. State of Kerala‟, 1973 Cri.L.J. 687, the Supreme

Court while dealing with Section 33 of the Evidence Act held that where

the presence of a witness examined in the Court of the committing

Magistrate cannot be obtained without an amount of delay and expense

which, under the circumstances of the case, the Court considers

unreasonable, and there was evidence to show that the attempts were

made to secure his presence in the Trial Court, his evidence can be

brought on record and will constitute substantive evidence.
98.          In the instant case, PW-Vikram was available to the

appellants throughout the trial which culminated in final disposal in 1976.

He was cross-examined at length by the appellants on various dates. He
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 108 of 201
 was available for appearance before the Court being in custody till 1985

before his release on bail in L.N.Misra case. In fact, he was confronted

with the statement made by him before Danapur jail in the said

proceedings. It is pertinent to note that the appellants had moved

CM.No.6300/1998 to bring on record the statement of PW-Vikram

recorded in Sessions Case No. 121/1996 (RC.No. 175 titled CBI vs.

Santoshanand and ors.), pending in the Court of the then learned Sessions

Judge Ms.Sharda Aggarwal. This Court allowed the application vide order

dated 22.11.2006. As observed above, efforts were made by the

prosecution to secure his presence in compliance with the order of the

Supreme Court but he was not available at both the addresses in Delhi as

well as in Bihar. There is nothing on record to show that CBI did not

make diligent search and reasonable exertion to trace the witness.

             Of course, the evidence of PW-Vikram who could not be

recalled for cross-examination would be viewed with a great degree of

caution. Endeavour will be made to act upon such testimony only if it is

materially corroborated or supported by the surrounding circumstances.

99.          Next limb of argument of the appellants‟ counsel is that PW-

Vikram is wholly unreliable and no reliance can be placed on his

evidence. The story given by the approver was a tissue of lies and was
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 109 of 201
 wholly improbable. Despite issuance of non-bailable warrants in

L.N.Mishra case, Vikram chose not to appear. Conduct and character of

the approver Vikram make him absolutely unreliable and untrustworthy

witness. Counsel further urged that statement of PW-Vikram is not a

statement which could come within the parameters of Section 306 Cr.P.C.

as he was never a willing party to the crime. The pardon granted to him

under Section 306 Cr.P.C. was illegal and unjustified as to his own

showing he was not a party to the crime. His position was not better than

that of PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia), PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) and PW-57 (Raj

Singh). The investigation is tainted and unfair. It is mystery as to how

PW-Vikram was taken as an accomplice or a conspirator when PW-4,

PW-55 & PW-57 with similar roles were associated as prosecution

witnesses. Total investigation including its trial was conducted by CBI

during Emergency era. PWs-44, 55 and 57 were illegally detained by CBI

and made to give evidence as per their dictates. They were bound down

for recording statements under Section 164 Cr.P.C. He further urged that

the evidence of Vikram approver could not improve the prosecution case.
 Countering the appellants‟ contentions, CBI counsel urged

that evidence of Vikram has to be appreciated, keeping in view the entire

evidence and the fact that he was examined before the Court eight times at
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 110 of 201
 different stages and he remained consistent and supported the case of the

prosecution in its entirety. He made a voluntary statement under Section

164 Cr.P.C. before the ACMM twice on 14.08.1975 and 16.08.1975. He

again made statement before the Court of CMM, Delhi while he was

examined under Section 306 Cr.P.C. before grant of pardon. Before the

case was committed to the Court of Sessions for trial, Vikram was

examined by the committal Court in L.N.Mishra case. During trial,

Vikram was examined as PW-1 over a period of time and his testimony

runs into about 225 pages. His examination as PW-2 in L.N.Mishra case

runs into 340 pages. Regarding statement allegedly made by Vikram

before Superintendent jail on 30.09.1978 at Danapur, it was strongly

urged that Vikram retracted that statement during his deposition,

subsequently, in L.N.Mishra case. The statement made before Danapur

jail authorities was recorded without any authority of law and in complete

violation of legal provisions which were outside the legal frame work. The

said statement is not admissible in evidence and appears to have been

procured putting him in fear. The evidence has been recorded in a manner

unknown to law. He further contended that report of Justice Tarakunde

was only an „opinion‟ and was not an admissible piece of evidence. There

was a conflict of interest in submitting the report as A-2 was one of his
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 111 of 201
 juniors and was represented by him (Justice Tarakunde) in the case. The

appellants never challenged the authenticity of the statement till 1998.

They waited for seventeen years to recall him knowing well that the said

evidence would not be available. There is nothing on record to show that

Vikram was an untrustworthy witness or he gave false evidence. As per

material available on record there is no doubt that Vikram was an

accomplice with the appellants in an attempt to murder the CJI. He was

part of the conspiracy and played an active role to achieve the object of

the conspiracy.
100.         Before adverting to the credibility of testimony of PW-

Vikram, it is pertinent to note that Vikram recorded his statement under

Sections    164     Cr.P.C.     during   investigation   before   PW-20

(Sh.R.D.Aggarwal), Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. PW-1 (Vikram)

was produced before him on August 12, 1975 at 03.00 P.M. He put certain

questions reproduced in Ex.P7 and directed Vikram to be produced on

August 14, 1975 at 10.00 A.M. He was ordered to be kept segregated

from others in the jail. As per PW-20‟s testimony. After recording the

statement (questionnaire) of Vikram, he had satisfied himself that there

was no inducement or threat of any kind and Vikram wanted to make

statement on his own accord. He again explained to Vikram that he was
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 112 of 201
 being sent to judicial custody so that he could compose himself and think

over as to whether he wanted to make statement. He also explained to

Vikram that he should not be under any kind of fear, because he would

not be sent back to police custody. On August 14, 1975, PW-20 explained

the whole position to Vikram once again. After satisfying himself that no

pressure of any kind had been exerted and no police officer or jail officers

had met Vikram during custody, he finally apprised Vikram that he was

not bound to make any statement before him or that any such statement (if

made) could be read in evidence against him. Vikram‟s statement (Ex.P8)

was recorded in question-answer form. After satisfying that Vikram

wanted to make a statement voluntarily without any inducement or

pressure of any kind, PW-20 recorded his statement (Ex.P9) at 11.35 A.M.

when none else was present inside the Court room. Certificate appended is

Ex.P9/A. Vikram also made endorsement (Ex.P9/C) in his own hand and

signatures. In the cross-examination, PW-20 denied the suggestion that

CBI and police officers were present in the Court room throughout when

Vikram‟s statement was recorded on August 14, 1975. He fairly admitted

that oath was administered to Vikram before recording his statement. He

denied the suggestion that Vikram had made the statement as he was

pressurized by administering the oath. He denied the suggestion that copy
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 113 of 201
 of the statement of Vikram as recorded by CBI was in his possession

while recording his statement.
101.         On scanning the testimony, it reveals that all the necessary

precautions were taken by the Judicial Magistrate. He was satisfied that

the statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. was being made by Vikram

voluntarily and was not the result of any duress or coercion by the police.

It was recorded after due warning and providing sufficient time to reflect.

Vikram was aware that he was making a statement before a Judicial

Magistrate independent of the police. PW-20 had given assurance of

protection against any apprehension, inducement, pressure and threat, etc.

Necessary certificate regarding the statement to be voluntary and free

from any pressure was appended by the Judicial Officer. Despite lengthy

cross-examination, nothing emerged to infer that mandatory requirements

of Section 164 Cr.P.C. were not adhered to before recording the statement

or that the Judicial Officer had any ulterior or extraneous consideration to

connive with CBI to record false statement at their behest as alleged.

Vikram himself appeared as PW-1 and categorically deposed that on

August 12, 1975, he told Sh.R.D. Aggarwal of his desire to make a

statement regarding the incidents at Samastipur resulting in the death of

L.N.Misra and subsequent attack on Chief Justice of India. He further
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 114 of 201
 deposed that he was given two days‟ time to reflect before making

statement. He was given further time to think over and was asked to sit in

the Court room and calmly deliberate about it. Statement (Ex.P9) under

Section 164 Cr.P.C. was made by him voluntarily of his own free will

without being influenced by anyone in any manner. The reason to make

statement was that he was convinced that he had done a wrong thing and

by giving that statement, he wanted to unburden himself. In the cross-

examination, nothing was suggested to him if the statement given by him

was under pressure or that necessary procedural safeguards were not

adhered to by the Judicial Magistrate in recording the statement. At no

stage, PW-1 (Vikram) challenged the genuineness and authenticity of the

statement (Ex.P9) made by him before the Judicial Magistrate.

102.         Vikram appeared as an approver before the Court and was

examined as PW-1. His Court statement runs into 162 pages (152 paras).

He gave detailed account as to how he joined the Organisation in 1965

when he was still a student of 9th class. He gave detailed history of his

association with the Organisation; the places where he stayed and

performed various jobs till July, 1974. During his short stay at D-41,

South Extension Part-I, he was introduced to A-1 an „Avadhoot‟, editor of

newspaper ""Prout"" printed and published from there. A-2, A-3, PW-4
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 115 of 201
 (Tilak Raj Bhatia) and PW-Raj Singh were visitors to the said premises.

In the end of 1972, he went to Jaipur and stayed there as Press Manager

till June 1974. He participated in a rally organized by the „Organisation‟

to secure the release of Baba Anand Murti on April 23, 1973 and was

arrested for violation of the orders under Section 144 Cr.P.C. on April 24;

remained in detention for about a month or so. Acharya Dhaneshanand

had committed self-immolation in the Purana Qila. After his release, he

went back to Jaipur and returned to Delhi in June, 1974 as press at Jaipur

had gone out of order. He resumed work in the press at Delhi and began to

live there.
103.          Vikram further deposed that on July 01 or 02, 1974 when he

had gone to South Extension market at about 02.00 or 02.20 P.M. A-1

called him by his name Vikram from a distance. At first instance, he was

unable to recognize A-1 as he had shaved off his beard and moustache. A-

1 was wearing pant and shirt at that time. When he (Vikram) recognized

him from voice and face and enquired as to why he (A-1) had changed his

dress and appearance, A-1 told him that it was to avoid the police who

was searching him after self-immolation of Dhaneshanand. A-1 told

Vikram that they needed men of revolutionary type who could secure

Baba‟s release by armed revolution. On that, he (Vikram) placed himself
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 116 of 201
 at A-1‟s disposal and agreed to do anything entrusted to him. A-1 asked

him to meet him at Pusa Gate at about 08.00 or 08.30 A.M. next day. As

per PW-1‟s testimony, he met A-1 at Pusa Gate who took him to the room

of Shiv Raj Singh in the hostel of Pusa Institute. A-1 told him that rallies

and the self-immolation had no effect on the Government with the result

that Baba could not be released; the only way to secure the release of the

Baba was through armed revolution. PW-1 declared to carry out any

orders given to him in that behalf as he had devoted his entire life to Baba.

At A-1‟s command, he shaved off his beard and cut the hair short. An

assumed name „Subir‟ was given to him by A-1.
104.         PW-1 further testified that A-1 handed over a closed

envelope and a packet to deliver to Budhishwaranand @ Amar Singh at

Bhagalpur at Anand Margi Primary School without disclosing its contents.

He left Delhi the same day by Upper India Express and delivered the

articles to Budhishwaranand @ Amar Singh who hailed from Unnao

District, U.P. He introduced him to Gopal ji in village Chautham, District

Monghyr and asked him to contact him in time of need and emergency;

they all used to have meetings at his farm at a distance of 5 / 7 miles from

Chautham. He further deposed that on July 13, 1974 at about 10.00 or

11.00 when he and Budhishwaranand @ Amar Singh were standing near a
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 117 of 201
 tomb in the vicinity of Anand Margi Primary School, the police arrested

Budhishwaranand      @     Amar    Singh.   He    informed    A-1     about

Budhishwaranand @ Amar Singh‟s arrest and his inability to pick up the

bag. On that, A-1 got annoyed and told him that the said packet contained

three hand-grenades. The witness further testified that he had attended two

or three meetings for armed revolution at Gopalji‟s house and at Tilhar

farm which were also attended by A-1, A-3, Arteshanand and Gopalji etc.

A-1 used to address those meetings and refrain of his talk in all the

meetings was that they could not secure the release of Baba by legal

means and they would have to collect as many arms as possible and take

resort to armed revolution. On A-1‟s instructions, he went to Narkatiya

Ganj and Chamua for collection of arms and met Paras Nath and Roop

Nath Misir but could not succeed to procure arms from them. In

November 1974 in a meeting at Rajgir, A-1 exhorted them to work for

„Shastra Krantikari Yuvak Sangh‟ and each one of them should enroll at

least 25 members of strong determination.
             On March 17, 1975, he met A-3 at Ashok Lodge near Gandhi

Maidan at Patna where A-1 had hired a room for the members to hold

secret meetings etc. On enquiry, A-3 told him that A-1 had gone to Delhi

and they were to reach there. On March 18, 1975, he and A-3 left Patna
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 118 of 201
 and arrived at Delhi on March 19. The witness revealed that A-3 had

carried a black bag with a zip from Patna to Delhi. At the time of leaving

Ashok Lodge, A-3 had asked him to be careful about the black bag which

contained three hand-grenades and it should be handled with care. At

Delhi, they went to Mehrauli bus stand where A-1 met and took them to

the house to PW-Raj Singh at Mehrauli and they spent the night there. On

March 20, when PW-Raj Singh was making arrangement for breakfast, A-

1 told him and A-3 that ""Ray sahib who is the Chief Justice of India is a

„Mahapapi‟ in as much as he had rejected the bail application of Baba ji

and had refused to transfer the case outside the State of Bihar relating to

Baba ji"". A-1 also said that ""he (Ray sahib) was openly a henchman of the

Indira Sarkar‟. Indira Sarkar had appointed him Chief Justice by

superseding 2 / 3 other judges"". He also emphasized that „so long as he

occupies the office of the Chief Justice of India it would be difficult to

secure justice for Baba ji‟. A-1 declared that ""he (Ray Sahib) had to be

finished off, and that we had therefore to go towards the Supreme Court"".

105.         The witness further informed that they arrived at the Supreme

Court from Mehrauli by a bus at about 09.30 A.M. A-1 told them that it

would not be advisable to attack the car of the Chief Justice of India in the

morning hours due to rush of people and it would be easier to attack in the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 119 of 201
 evening when the car would stop at traffic lights, at the junction of Tilak

Marg and Bhagwan Dass Road. At about 10.00 A.M. A-1 spotted the car

with a flag flying on the bonnet coming from the direction of India Gate.

Only Chief Justice was sitting in the back seat.
106.         Revealing the movements on that day, PW-Vikram recalled

that A-1 took him and A-3 to Rama Krishna park at Panchkuin Road at

about 11.00 A.M. There, in the park, A-1 told him that in the evening

when the car of the Chief Justice would stop at the traffic lights, he would

throw a hand-grenade into the car from the right side; A-3 would similarly

throw a hand-grenade from the left side. He further told him that if any of

those present there tried to chase A-1 or A-3, he (Vikram) would throw a

hand-grenade at the chasers. He was asked to stand on the corner towards

the DDA flats at the crossing of Tilak Marg and Bhagwan Dass Road. A-1

also showed him a torch which contained only a glass tube filled with

whitish liquid and told him that after being broken on the ground, it would

emit smoke to serve as a smoke screen to escape without being seen by

the crowd. A-1 told him that before throwing the hand-grenade, he should

break the tube to create smoke screen and in case any among the crowd

chased them, he should throw the hand-grenade at them. They stayed in

the park till 02.00 P.M. A little before 02.00 P.M. A-1 had gone towards
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 120 of 201
 the direction of Panchkuin Road leaving him and A-3 behind in the park.

After 10 or 15 minutes, A-1 came back accompanied by PW-4 (Tilak Raj

Bhatia) who had a radio shop at Panchkuin Road.
107.          The witness further stated that A-1 told PW-4 (Tilak Raj

Bhatia) to arrange a taxi as they wanted to visit places in Delhi. PW-4

(Tilak Raj Bhatia) took all of them to Gole Market and booked a taxi

driven by a Sardar ji. In the taxi, first they went to Budha Jayanti Park,

then to India Gate and thereafter to Children‟s Park. At India Gate, they

all including the driver ate ice-creams. While visiting Amar Jyoti, A-1

exhorted them to take inspiration from it. At Children‟s Park, all the three

went inside it. A-1 and A-3 went away to return after easing themselves at

about 03.45 P.M. A-1 and A-3 returned after 10 or 15 minutes. A-1

ordered the taxi to hurry up to the Bhagwan Dass Road as he wanted to

meet someone there, lest he should miss him. They came to DDA flats

near Bhagwan Dass Road and stopped the taxi there. It was about 04.00

P.M. They all got down from the taxi. A-1 opened the bag; took one hand-

grenade for himself, gave one each to him and A-3. He also gave him a

torch containing a tube. The empty bag which contained clothes, etc. was

left behind in the taxi. PW- Tilak Raj Bhatia and the driver were asked to

keep sitting in the taxi till their return.

 108.         Highlighting the role played by each of them in the execution

of the plan, PW-Vikram continued to reveal that after taking respective

position at the spot, a little later, the car of CJI flying the flag came out of

the gate reserved for the Judges. It stopped at the traffic lights, due to red

light, at the crossing of Tilak Marg with Bhagwan Dass Road. He further

revealed ""No sooner did the car of the Chief Justice stop there than

Santoshanand (A-1) rushed towards the car with the hand-grenade

wrapped in the handkerchief in his hand. He went up to the right side rear

window of the car. Similarly, Sudevanand (A-3) also reached the rear

window on the left side of the car carrying the hand-grenade wrapped in a

handkerchief. Santoshanand (A-1) threw the hand-grenade into the car

and immediately he went towards Sudevanand (A-3) from behind the car.

Sudevanand (A-3) also threw the hand-grenade into the car and then ran

in the direction of Bhagwan Dass Road from behind the car.""

             He further disclosed that while fleeing the spot, A-3

discarded „V‟shape „hawai‟ chappals on the right side of the car.

Describing the post-event situation, Vikram informed that Jamadar of

Chief Justice and others chased A-3 shouting „Pakaro-Pakaro‟. He was

also among the chasers. A-3 entered into the waiting taxi; came out of it;

went towards the Garhwal House and scaled over its gate. He also entered
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 122 of 201
 inside the Garhwal House and threw the hand-grenade and torch in the

bushes. He did not see A-3 thereafter. The witness gave detailed account

as to how from there, he first went to Mandi House, then to Regal

Cinema, Koria Pul, Shahadara and finally to Ghaziabad. He left for Patna

by Upper India Express. From Patna, he went to Chakia. After a few days,

on enquiry from A-3, he falsely informed him due to fear of A-1 that he

had broken the tube but it had no effect. On 07.04.1975, he met A-1 at

Ashoka Lodge and apprised him that he had broken the tube as advised.

A-1 got angry for discarding the hand-grenades in the bushes and directed

him to go back and search it out. On 09.04.1975, he went to the house of

Raj Singh in Mehrauli and under the guise of a „Kabari‟, went near

Garhwal House to retrieve the hand-grenade but finding the police

presence there, he did not dare to go and returned to Patna. The witness

revealed that meetings were held at Tilhar which were attended by all of

them including A-1 and A-3. Again, attempt was made by him to procure

arms but in vain. On 24.07.1975, he and A-3 were arrested at Bhagalpur.

PW-Vikram identified handwriting and signatures of A-1 on various

documents (Ex.P10 to Ex.P15).
109.         Vikram was cross-examined at length. He gave detailed

answers to the questions put to him regarding his arrest at Bhagalpur and
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 123 of 201
 the statement made by him in Samastipur case. He did not have any

hesitation to admit that prior to July 24, 1975, he had complete faith in

Baba and considered him incarnation of the God. He gave description of

the CJI to whom he was able to recognise if appeared before him. He was

confronted with the statement (Ex.D1) recorded under Section 161

Cr.P.C. where he had omitted to state certain facts. He gave explanation

for the said omissions. He told that on July 27, 1975, he was produced

before a Magistrate. While handing over his custody to CBI, he asked him

to keep his face covered to participate in TIP. He declined to participate in

the TIP on July 30 in Tihar jail. On August 01, 1975 during police custody

remand, he disclosed everything to the police. The pardon was granted to

him in Samastipur incident in October, 1975. Regarding his arrest at

Bhagalpur, he disclosed that he and A-3 were on their way to the Court in

a rickshaw. They had left the house at Nath Nagar on July 24, at about 12

or 01 o‟clock and were arrested in between 02.00 to 03.00 P.M. He denied

the suggestion that he was a police informer and had been instrumental in

getting these persons arrested wherever he went. He further denied that he

had planned to get A-1 and A-3 arrested at Gopalji‟s house and that it was

just a matter of chance that they had left earlier.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 124 of 201
 110.         Elaborating the crime-spot, he revealed that the taxi stood at

a distance of about 40 yards and was visible from the place where he had

taken up position. The constable was between him and the taxi and the

distance was 25 or 30 yards. He denied the suggestion that A-3 did not

enter the taxi because for one reason or the other it did not start. The

witness explained that subsequently, on enquiry from A-3 as to why he

had not escaped in the taxi after entering into it, he gave the reason that it

did not start. He disclosed that the gentleman who was sitting with the CJI

on the rear seat was 25 years of age, fair complexion and as tall as he

himself was. He admitted discarding of the hand-grenades after his escape

from the scene of Samastipur Kand due to fear of arrest by the police. He

expressed ignorance if the hand-grenades fallen from his hands had

subsequently come in the hands of a child and exploded there injuring

someone.
111.         Answering the varied queries, he further revealed that while

chasing A-3 after the incident, he had crossed Tilak Raj Bhatia before

running to the Garhwal House. He was not aware as to why Tilak Raj

Bhatia was included in the team that day as it was for A-1 to decide to

whom to include and not to include. He was not aware if Tilak Raj Bhatai

was a party to the conspiracy. He further informed that he and A-3 had
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 125 of 201
 travelled by Assam Mail from Patna to Delhi without reservation of seats.

The train arrives at Delhi at 05.00 or 06.00 P.M. after its departure on the

previous day at 10.00 or 11.00 P.M. He denied the suggestion that he

travelled from Patna to Delhi by Delhi Express on March 18 after making

reservation and was not in Delhi on March 19 evening. He claimed that

there was no quarrel between him and A-1 and denied the suggestion that

he had hit A-1 on the forehead with an iron rod in 1972. He added that

throughout his association with A-1, he had good relations with him. A-1

had trained him in the use of hand-grenades.
112.         Depicting the crime scene, he disclosed that at the place of

occurrence, A-1 and A-3 held their respective hand-grenades in one hand

from the middle of the lever. To his view, A-1 took out the hand-grenade

from his right pocket in his right hand; covered it with the handkerchief

taken out from the left hand pocket. A-1 had thrown the hand-grenade into

the car after getting quite close to it. The car of CJI had stopped at the

traffic lights with its front wheels touching the „stop‟ line. The word

""STOP"" was written in a very bold letters cutting across the entire lane of

the signal stop.
113.         Regarding his visit to Pusa Institute, he deposed that he

travelled to the said institute by bus. Shiv Raj‟s room from the Pusa Gate
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 126 of 201
 was at a distance of ½ or ¾ km. He further disclosed that Raj Singh‟s

house was at a distance of about a furlang from the bus stand and it was a

„pakka‟ house having two or three rooms.
114.         In the cross-examination (on behalf of A-3), the witness gave

detailed account regarding his family; his association with the

Organisation; the oath administered to him by Parkashanand ji; his

participation in the various activities of various wings of the Organisation;

his association with A-1, A-3 and other active members of the

Organisation including Madhavanand; philosophy of the Organisation and

his meetings with Anand Murti ji twice. He denied the suggestion that he

was expelled from the „Organisation‟ for abducting a girl and committing

theft. He further denied that due to his frustration for failure to get a job,

he became a whole time worker in the „Organisation‟. He gave the names

of various Anand Margis who had defected from the „Organisation‟. He

was not aware if Madhavanand, Onkaranand, Naval Kishore, Ujjawal,

Chiranand and Chidatamanand had defected from the „Organisation‟. He

gave detailed account of the meetings that took place at Gopalji‟s house

and added that A-1, A-3, Gopal ji, Artheshanand and he had attended the

said meetings. He was not aware if any attempt was made to poison Baba

Ji to death in the jail. He denied the suggestion that he joined A-1 because
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 127 of 201
 he was enraged over the news that attempt had been made to poison Baba

in jail and added that he was, however, at one, with A-1 to secure Baba‟s

release by any means. He gave detailed account regarding Sadhana Pitha

Training (SPT) in 1969 at Varansi. He disclosed that he did not know

Sudhir Kumar Basedar and was not aware if the original name of

Advetanand was Sudhir Kumar Basedar. He was questioned regarding his

association with Khub Lal who had introduced him to Paras Nath in

connection with procurement of arms. He stated that he had gone to

Narkatia Ganj in October 1974 for this purpose. He denied the suggestion

that he was arrested at Varansi on the alleged charge of conspiracy by

Anand Margis to kill Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India.

115.         About Tilak Raj Bhatia, he disclosed that he had visited his

shop twice or thrice and he (PW-4) knew him by the name of Vikram. He

denied the suggestion that he used to go to Tilak Raj Bhatia‟s house for

delivering newspapers „Prout‟. He admitted that PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia)

did not meet him at all after this occurrence. He denied the suggestion that

he had told Tilak Raj Bhatia that day that they were in possession of hand-

grenades and that they were out to kill the CJI.
             About PW-Raj Singh, he told that he had been visiting the

press earlier and he had also visited his house five or six times before
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 128 of 201
 March 19, 1975. Raj Singh had been residing in a different house at that

time which was at a distance of 1500 to 2000 yards from the house where

he was living on March 19. He denied that when he had left Raj Singh‟s

house in the disguise of a „kabari‟, he told him that he got entangled in

that affair by deceit and that he had not done any such thing.

             He admitted acquaintance with Janki Prasad who had become

a member of „Akhil Bhartiya Shastra Vipalavi Chhatar Yuva Sangh‟. He

was not aware if Janki Prasad was an agent of CBI and that he in league

with him got A-3 arrested. Denying the suggestion that Janki Prasad was

the third passenger in the rickshaw at Bhagalpur where he and A-3 were

arrested, he added that he had seen Janki Prasad at the railway station on

July 24, 1975 but did not meet him.
116.         In para-87 of the statement, he disclosed that he was aware of

topography of the area due to distribution of the „paper‟ from time to time

during the period he had been working in the local press. About crime

scene, he disclosed that the car of the Chief Justice arrived at the traffic

lights 5 or 7 minutes after he had taken up position. He admitted that but

for the red lights, their decision was not to throw the hand-grenades. He

elaborated that their plan was that in case the car did not stop there, they

would try some other time. It had not been decided as to when and where
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 129 of 201
 the other attempt was to be made. Their next programme in event of the

car not stopping there depended upon A-1. A-1 had told them that as soon

as the hand-grenades exploded, they would escape in the taxi in the

resultant confusion. There was no contingency plan in the event of the taxi

not being available there. He denied the suggestion that false statements

were made by him in the Court because he had joined hands with

Datgatanand, Vishokanand and Parkashanand in league with the CBI.

117.         In the cross-examination on behalf of Ram Nagina Prasad

(since acquitted), he denied the suggestion that he was given only a torch

without any tube in it and that the said torch was supposed to itself emit

smoke. He further disclosed that the sikh gentleman who drove the taxi

was wearing khaki pants and shirt, brown colour turban and was aged

about 35 or 40 years. He categorically stated that neither did he ask the

police to make him an approver nor did the police ask him to become an

approver. All that he had said was that he was prepared to state the truth

regardless of its consequences. He agreed to be a party to the conspiracy

of throwing the hand-grenades and breaking the tube, because the element

of fear never entered his mind. He did not break the tube because the

hand-grenades did not explode.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 130 of 201
 118.         Replying the questions put in the cross-examination on

behalf of A-2, he stated that in the newspapers in 1975 he read that the

government had banned the „Organisation‟. He denied the suggestion that

from the very beginning, he had joined the „Organisation‟ with a plan to

get into it and do espionage work inside it, get some Anand Margis

involve in criminal cases and then become an approver. He denied that

after his arrest on July 24, 1975, he was subjected to severe beatings by

the police or that he was served with food and drinks and was entertained

to induce him to make a statement as they wanted. He admitted that there

was no talk at all about the conspiracy to kill the CJI in any of their

meetings held in the State of Bihar. He claimed that when he was engaged

in all these activities, he knew that he was running the risk of his life but

that did not bother him because he was prepared to do anything for Baba.

He stated that he did not give any suggestion to A-1 and A-3 any time by

way of dissent or otherwise because they were his leaders and it was his

duty to follow them. Denying the suggestion that A-1 himself used to go

to the Supreme Court for the „paravi‟ of bail applications, PW-Vikram

added that Acharya Ram Tanuk, a lawyer, used to visit the Supreme Court

for this purpose and stay at D-41, South Extension during his visits to

Delhi. It is apt to note here that name of Sh.Ram Tanuk, Advocate, finds
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 131 of 201
 mention in various orders of the Supreme Court (Ex.P-95, Ex.P-96 and

Ex.P-98) whereby he represented the head of the „Organisation‟. He

denied the suggestion that the tube was not broken to create smoke screen,

because he was a dishonest man and was in league with CBI. He

explained that he did not avail the taxi for his escape, because he wanted

to go after A-3 for his help. He admitted that he had followed A-3 keeping

in mind that if anybody tried to catch him, he would kill him by throwing

the hand-grenade.
119.         On analysis of the broad features of Vikram‟s evidence

described above, it reveals that PW-Vikram has given detailed account

from the inception to the end of all the events and his testimony is quite

expatiated. He was a dedicated follower of the „Organisation‟ which he

joined in 1965 during his childhood. He had utmost faith in the

„Organisation‟ and was ready and willing to sacrifice his life for its cause.

He was an active whole time worker of the „Organisation‟ and had deep

knowledge about its philosophy. He had close association with A-1 and

was ready and willing to obey his command at all costs. He participated in

various meetings attended by A-1 and A-3 in Delhi and outside Delhi. On

the day of arrest on July 24, 1975, he was with A-3 at Bhagalpur. Though

various suggestions have been put regarding his wrong doings in the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 132 of 201
 „Organisation‟, no evidence emerged on record to show if at any time his

bonafide was suspected or he was expelled from the „Organisation‟.

Nothing has come on record if A-1 or A-3 or the „Organisation‟ had any

grievance whatsoever against his conduct and behaviour before recording

statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. Even in Tihar jail, he had declined to

participate in TIP as advised by A-1. He was in a fix to make complete

disclosure of the facts during investigation till August 11 by CBI. When

he was produced on August 12, 1975 before Sh.R.D.Aggarwal, ACMM,

he expressed desire to record statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. In the

statement given to the Judicial Magistrate as well as before the Court, he

not only clearly implicated A-1 and A-3 but also involved himself for

actively participating in the execution of the conspiracy to throw hand-

grenades on the car in which CJI was travelling. His involvement in the

incident had come prior to his arrest on July 24, 1975 in this case.

120.         Despite lengthy and indepth cross-examination on various

dates, the appellants were unable to extract or elicit any material

discrepancy or variation to doubt the version narrated by him. He gave

minute detail of the events as to how A-1 had instigated / exhorted him to

resort to illegal means for release of Baba from jail; how he had

participated in the execution of the plan on March 20, 1975. The
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 133 of 201
 appellants were unable to shatter his testimony on vital aspects or to bring

out any major infirmity in it. Learned counsel for the appellants assailing

the statement of approver on various grounds pointed out numerous

alleged contradictions and improvements in his statement. True, Vikram

has made certain improvements in his deposition before the Court and the

facts deposed in the Court were omitted to be so mentioned in his

statements recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. or 164 Cr.P.C. However,

when confronted the witness gave elaborate explanation for their

omissions and furnished reasonable clarifications. The discrepancies /

improvements referred to by the appellants‟ counsel are minor,

insignificant, natural and not material. Marginal variations in the

statement cannot be dubbed as improvements as these are in fact details

and description of the narrations extracted by the defence counsel in the

lengthy cross-examination of the approver. It may be worthwhile to notice

that wherever any alleged contradiction or improvement was confronted

to the witness, the learned Trial Court had made a note of it in the

statement at the time of recording of the deposition of the witness. These

omissions do not go to the root of the prosecution case to shake its basic

structure. The law is very clear on this aspect; only such omissions which

amount to contradiction in material particulars can be used to discredit the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 134 of 201
 testimony of a witness. In „Narayan Chetanram Chaudhary & anr. vs.

State of Maharastra‟, 2000 (8) SCC 457, the Supreme Court held :


121.         In „State of U.P. vs. M.K.Anthony‟, (supra), Supreme Court

held :

122.         I am satisfied that contradictions (if any) are only minimal

and would not affect the claim of the prosecution case or discredit his

statement. Contrary to that, various conflicting and inconsistent

suggestions have been given to Vikram in the cross-examination which

strengthen the deposition given by him in the Court regarding the role

attributed to the appellants. PW-Vikram had no extraneous motive to

make a false statement as he himself had remained in detention / custody

for long ten years despite being granted pardon. The suggestions given to

PW-Vikram in the cross-examination are worth-noting.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 136 of 201
       (i)     I deny the suggestion that I became Avadhoot in the jail.

              (PW-Vikram never claimed himself to be an „Avadhoot‟).

      (ii)    It is correct that the hand-grenades given to him for throwing

              for the Samastipur „kand‟ had been subsequently discarded

              by him in the same manner as I had discarded the hand-
              grenades in the present case. (Apparently suggesting active

              participation of the witness in the crime).
      (iii)   I deny the suggestion that I had been a police informer and

              had been instrumental in getting these persons arrested

              wherever I went. I deny the suggestion that I had planned to

              get (Santoshanand) (A-1) and (Sudevanand) (A-3) arrested at

              Gopalji‟s house and that it was just a matter of chance that

              they had left earlier.
      (iv)    I deny the suggestion that (Sudevanand) A-3 did not enter the

              taxi because for one reason or the other the taxi did not start.

      (v)     I deny the suggestion that he (PW-Vikram) travelled from

              Patna to Delhi by Delhi Express on March 18 after making

              reservation. I deny that I was not in Delhi on March 19

              evening.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 137 of 201
       (vi)   It is correct that I deliberately did not tell him about my

             participation in the armed revolution because I felt that he

             should not be told about it. It did not occur to me as to what

             would be the consequences if I disclosed this thing to him.

      (vii) I deny the suggestion that Visheshwaranand and I acted in

             concert for the „Samastipur Kand‟.
      (viii) I deny the suggestion that I joined Santoshanand (A-1)

             because I was enraged over the news of an attempt to poison

             Baba in jail.
      (ix)   I deny the suggestion that I had shaved off my beard and cut

             my hair short a day before I went to Pusa Gate.
      (x)    I deny the suggestion that when I went to Raj Singh‟s house

             again and left in the disguise of a „kabari‟, I had told him that

             I got entangled in that affair by deceit and that I had not done

             any such thing.
      (xi)   I deny the suggestion that I used to go to Tilak Raj Bhatia‟s

             house for delivering the newspaper ""Prout"". It is correct that I

             had not met Tilak Raj Bhatia at all after this occurrence.

       (xii) I deny the suggestion that I had told Tilak Raj Bhatia that day

             (March 20) that we were in possession of hand-grenades and

             that we were out to kill the Chief Justice of India.
      (xiii) I deny the suggestion that Janki Prasad was the third

             passenger in the rickshaw at Bhagalpur where he and A-3

             were arrested.
      (xiv) I deny the suggestion that none of them told me that they had

             been procuring arms from Ram Nagina Prasad and that I

             have made my statement as recorded above merely on the

             basis of a conversation between (Santoshanand) A-1 and

             (Sudevanand) A-3 which was over heard by me.
      (xv) I deny the suggestion that I had been given only a torch

             without any tube in it and that the torch given to me was

             supposed to itself emit smoke.
      (xvi) It is correct that in all those meetings the attendance was

             never more than 5 or 6 persons.
      (xvii) I deny the suggestion that I did not break the tube to create

             the smoke screen, because I was a dishonest man and was in

             league with the CBI.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 139 of 201
        (xviii) It is correct that I had followed Sudevanand (A-3) keeping in

             mind that if anyone tried to catch him, I would kill him by

             throwing the hand-grenade.

123.         Appellants‟ counsel were specifically asked about the

purpose and relevance of these suggestions given to PW-Vikram in the

cross-examination to which they had no answer.
124.         The suggestions made in the cross-examination form part of

the evidence on record. Those suggestions can be taken into consideration

while determining whether the reply given was believable or not [„Jamal

Ahmad & ors. vs. State of U.P.‟, 1979 ACR 185 (High Court of

Allahabad)]. In „Hazara Singh vs. Jinder Singh & ors.‟, 1997 (1) SCALE

477, the Supreme Court observed, "".......On the contrary from the

suggestion made to the witness Hazara Singh in cross-examination that

the young wife of Dhyan Singh was a lady of easy virtues and was once

found in compromising position with one Amar Singh, indicated that the

accused did not dispute the earlier occurrence with Kulwant Singh."" In

„Jesu Asir Singh & ors. vs. State through Inspector of Police‟, (2007) 12

SCC 19, the Supreme Court observed, ""the question put in the cross-

examination to a great extent probabilise the prosecution version. Though

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 140 of 201
 questions put in cross-examination are not always determinative in

finding an accused guilty, they are certainly relevant.""

125.           I am conscious that the prosecution must stand on its own

legs and it cannot derive any strength from the weakness of the defence.

Though the suggestions made in the cross-examination is not evidence but

certainly the same may be called into aid only to lend assurance to the

prosecution case; particularly when other evidence establishes the guilt of

the accused.
126.           The appellants did not produce any evidence in defence to

controvert or falsify the facts disclosed by PW-Vikram in his detailed

examination before the Court. Nothing was suggested to him as to from

where else he was arrested. PW-Vikram attributed and assigned definite

and specific role to each of the appellants in the occurrence minutely. His

assertion on vital facts remained unchallenged and uncontroverted in the

cross-examination. In fact, Vikram‟s cross-examination is on fringes and

reflects appellants‟ reluctance to question him on vital substantive aspects.

All sorts of questions having no relevance with the main issues have been

put to him even to test his knowledge about the philosophy of the

„Organisation‟. Nothing was suggested to PW-Vikram, an active member

of the „Organisation‟ about his presence on March 19 or 20, 1975. A-1
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 141 of 201
 and A-3 even did not deny their presence in Delhi during the relevant

period. PW-Vikram was fair enough not to implicate A-2 for joining the

conspiracy or assisting the conspirators in any manner in the execution of

the conspiracy. The only role attributed to him was that A-1 had disclosed

him that CJI was shown to him by A-2 in the Supreme Court. He did not

implicate PWs - Tilak Raj Bhatia, Shiv Raj Singh or Raj Singh for joining

the conspiracy. He was fair enough to reveal that before March 20, 1975

he was not aware if hand-grenades were to be thrown at the car of the CJI.

He also disclosed that he was unable to procure arms and ammunitions

despite efforts made by him. PW-Vikram‟s testimony clearly and un-

erringly establishes the active role played by A-1 and A-3 in the execution

of the plan.
127.           I do not subscribe to the appellants‟ contention that pardon

granted was not legal under Section 306 Cr.P.C. The principle of

tendering pardon to an accomplice is to unravel the truth in a grave

offence so that guilt of other accused persons concerned in commission of

crime could be brought home. Detailing the object to grant pardon,

Supreme Court in „Narayan Chetanram Chaudhary & anr. vs. State of

Maharastra‟ (supra), held that the accomplice‟s evidence is taken on

record as a matter of necessity in case where it is impossible to get
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 142 of 201
 sufficient evidence of a heinous crime unless one of the participators in

the crime is disposed to disclose the circumstances within his knowledge

on account of tender of pardon. Approving the observations in „Suresh

Chandra Bahri vs. State of Bihar‟, 1995 SCC (Crl.) 60, it held : ""....The

basis of the tender of pardon is not the extent of the culpability of the

person to whom pardon is granted, but the principle is to prevent the

escape of the offenders from punishment in heinous offences for lack of

evidence. There can therefore be no objection against tender of pardon to

an accomplice simply because in his confession, he does not implicate

himself to the same extent as the other accused because all that Section

306 requires is that pardon may be tendered to any person believed to be

involved directly or indirectly in or privy to an offence. ""
130.         Regarding nature and extent of corroboration, the Court held

:

131.         The Supreme Court in „Mrinal Dass vs. State of Tripura‟,

2011 (9) SCC 479, held :

132.         Appreciation of Vikram‟s evidence shows that he is a reliable

witness. In his examination-in-chief, he clearly stated that he was one of

the accused in the case and during investigation he was arrested by the

CBI. In categorical terms, he asserted that he was aware of the whole

incident which led to the throwing of hand-grenades in the car of CJI and

was also connected with and involved in the incident along with others.

133.         From the judgment of the Trial Court, it is crystal clear that

the Court was conscious of the credibility of the approver witness and

insisted upon corroborative evidence in material particulars of the

depositions made by him to see as to whether his evidence was reliable

and whether the same was corroborated in material particulars to assume

its trueness first. The Trial Court in its judgment referred to several

corroborated circumstances and concluded that these assured the

correctness and truthfulness of the version of the approver.

134.         I have minutely scrutinized the evidence of PW-Vikram and

the corroborative evidence discussed in detail above and find no substance

in the submission of learned counsel for the appellants that the testimony

of PW-Vikram has not been corroborated in material particulars. In the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 147 of 201
 evidence given by the approver before the Trial Court, he had definitely

and unequivocally implicated A-1 & A-3 in the commission of the crime.

The statement of PW-1 is vivid in explanation and inspires full confidence

of the Court. The corroborative evidence to the aforesaid statement leaves

no doubt in the mind of the Court regarding the involvement of the

appellants. He recorded his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. before

judicial authorities without any delay ruling out possibility of tutoring.

The confessional statement recorded by Vikram amply proves the

allegations. The evidence in Court does not suffer from any infirmity.

PW-Vikram has spoken of presence of A-1 and A-3 during the whole

transaction and has unequivocally attributed specific and definite role to

each of them in the crime. In the morning, they all had gone to Supreme

Court to observe the situation. They stayed and surveyed the area and

decided to execute the plan in the evening. Vikram, who had no enmity

with the appellants, has been very consistent about the factual matrix not

only in his statements under Sections 161/164 Cr.P.C. but also before the

Court and has supported the prosecution case fully. The statement of the

approver inspires confidence including the conspiracy part which gets full

support from the narration of the occurrence given by several other

impartial witnesses. There is nothing wrong in accepting his entire
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 148 of 201
 statement and true disclosure of the incident coupled with corroboration

with the independent witnesses. Vikram is the solitary witness of all the

circumstances to be used against the accused persons.

135.         The analysis of the statements of various witnesses PW-2 (Jai

Nand), PW-4 (Tilak Raj Bhatia), PW-5 (Charan Singh), PW-57 (Raj

Singh), PW-55 (Shiv Raj Singh) and others, clearly strengthen the case of

PW-Vikram (the approver) in all aspects including conspiracy / planning

to attack CJI for rejection of bail; to make an attempt on his life, actual

incident; role played by the assailants and subsequent events. I am

satisified that by these statements, the prosecution has strengthened its

case through PW-Vikram, the approver, and there is no reason to

disbelieve his version. Judged on the background of the legal position as

stated above, the evidence of PW-Vikram does not suffer from any

infirmity to warrant rejection for his evidence is not really uncorroborated.

Even circumstantial evidence can provide the corroboration. In the instant

case, the evidence of PW-Vikram therefore, clearly meets the requirement

of Section 114 (b) in the background of Section 133 of the Evidence Act.

(E)    Whether PW-4, PW-44, PW-55 & PW-57 were accomplices

136.         Appellants‟ counsel strenuously urged to exclude the

evidence tendered by these witnesses as they themselves were
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 149 of 201
 accomplices / co-conspirators. All of them were aware about the

conspiracy in question from the inception and facilitated the appellants in

fulfilling its object in one way or the other. Counsel laid considerable

stress on the fact that they did not lodge a complaint to the police to

prevent the crime. They were in CBI custody for about ten days as

suspects and remained absent from their duties. Initially, they were

marked „absent‟ in their office record. Subsequently, absence period was

treated as „regular‟ and they were taken to be on „duty‟. Apparently, they

had every temptation to give evidence as desired by CBI. An accomplice

cannot corroborate another. Corroboration of one tainted evidence by

another tainted evidence can in no manner be called independent

corroboration.
             Dealing with this aspect in paras 181, 182 and 183, the Trial

Judge concluded that they were not accomplices. I am in agreement with

these findings. In „Sheshanna vs. The State of Maharashtra‟, AIR 1970

SC 1330, the Supreme Court explaining the meaning of an accomplice

observed : ""any party to the crime charged and someone who aids and

abets the commission of the crime. ""

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 150 of 201
             In „Jagannath vs. Emperor‟, AIR 1942 Oudh 221, it was

held:

             It further held that the burden of proving that a witness is an

accomplice ordinarily is upon the body alleging it for the purpose of

invoking the rule, namely the accused.
137.         In the instant case, nothing emerged to infer if these

witnesses had conscious hand in the crime or played an active role. It is

unclear if any of them was privy to the „conspiracy‟ or was aware of its

existence. None of them procured any arm or ammunition to carry out the

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 152 of 201
 unholy plan of the „conspiracy‟. No incriminating material was recovered

from their possession. This is true that they did not report or convey the

information to the police at the relevant time but this by itself does not

make them accomplices. The mere fact that a person did not reveal his

knowledge of the intended crime to the authorities does not make him an

accomplice. They have given reasonable explanation that due to threats

extended by the appellant and being in fear, they refrained from doing so.

(When a person under threat of death or other forms of pressure which he

is unable to resist commits a crime along with others, he is not a willing

participant in it but a victim of it. Such a person can hardly be called an

accomplice („Sriniwas Mull Bairoliya & Anr. vs. Emperor‟, AIR 1947 PC

135). Omission to inform the authorities promptly does not constitute him

an accomplice. An accused is a person who has concurred in the

commission of an offence. Since all of them were followers of the same

„Organisation‟ at one time, their association with the appellants during the

relevant period cannot be taken incriminating to discredit their testimonies

and entangle them in the cobweb of the conspiracy. They appear to be

victims of circumstances. They were used by the appellants. They did not

know the nature of conspiracy hatched by the accused persons. Their


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 153 of 201
 evidence cannot be discarded as tainted evidence; they were to gain

nothing by telling falsehood.
138.         The appellants did not admit or confess themselves to be

perpetrators of the crime. Specific and direct questions were put to the

appellants‟ counsel during arguments to elaborate and explain as to with

whom these witnesses were in „conspiracy‟ and what was its design or

purpose. The appellants had no answer to it.
             It is pertinent to note that application under Section 190 (b)

Cr.P.C. on behalf of A-1 was moved before the Trial Court through

Counsel to take cognizance against these witnesses for hatching

conspiracy, harbouring criminals, failure to inform the authorities about

commission of crime under Sections 120B/109/202/212 etc. and to try

them jointly with the accused persons on 03.05.1976. This application was

dismissed then and there as the Trial Court was not competent to take any

such cognizance. It appears that the appellant did not challenge the order

further. The contents of the application rather lend credence to the

prosecution case whereby the appellants did not deny „conspiracy‟ in

attacking CJI. Their only grievance was as to why these witnesses were

not made accused along with them and why they were taken as witnesses.


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 154 of 201
 139.         Even if it is presumed that at one stage or the other, these

witnesses assisted the appellants in some way or the other, it will not

efface the crime committed by them (the appellants). The appellants

cannot be exonerated or given clean chit due to failure of prosecution to

put them on trial. In „Ranjit Singh vs. State‟, 1997 VAD (Delhi) 689, This

Court observed that failure to put up Bhinderwala or anyone else for trial

would not absolve the appellant of criminality on the charge of

conspiracy. It observed :

140.         It is well settled that all accessories before the fact, if they

participate in the preparation of the crime are accomplices, but if their

participation is limited to the knowledge that crime is to be committed,

they are not accomplices.
(F)          Motive (A-1 & A-3)

141.         Normally, there is a motive behind every criminal act and for

that reason investigating agencies as well as the Court try to ascertain as

to what was the motive on the part of the accused to commit the crime in

question while examining his complicity. In a case which is based upon

circumstantial evidence, motive for committing the crime on the part of

the accused assumes greater importance. The Trial Court in para 103 of

the judgment has dealt with this circumstance extensively and was of the

definite view that A-1 and A-3 had strong and clear motive to commit the

crime. Both, A-1 and A-3 were unflinchingly committed followers of the

„Organisation‟ whose head / founder / preceptor to whom they considered
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 156 of 201
 incarnation of God could not come out of jail due to rejection of the bail

applications and transfer petition by the Bench headed by CJI. Evidence

has come on record that A-1 developed the belief that so long as

Sh.A.N.Ray (CJI) was the head of the judiciary, peaceful and legal means

would not secure release of Anand Murti and that armed revolution was

the only way to get him released. He developed a vengeful attitude

towards the CJI. This prejudice and hatred impelled A-1 to take the

extreme step. Apparently, the target of the dastardly intrigue was CJI.

PW-Vikram was categorical to depose that even on March 20, in the

morning, before leaving Raj Singh‟s house A-1 had told him and A-3 that

CJI was „Mahapapi‟ and that he had rejected the bail and transfer

applications of Anand Murti and that it would be difficult to secure the

release of Anand Murti so long as he was CJI and therefore, he had to be

finished off. The prosecution placed on record copies (Ex.P98 to Ex.P100)

of the relevant documents from the records of the Supreme Court to show

that CJI headed different Benches who dismissed the bail applications of

Anand Murti and transfer petition during the period March 25, 1974 and

October 30, 1974. Being a dedicated follower of the „Organisation‟ and

having complete faith in the head of the „Organisation‟, it was the earnest

desire of A-1 to get him released from detention at the earliest. The
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 157 of 201
 attempts to get him released on bail or to get the matter transferred did not

yield any result. It impelled A-1 even without taking into confidence the

„Organisation‟ to hatch conspiracy with Vikram, A-3 and other followers

of the „Organisation‟ to plan and attack CJI to get rid of him. For that end

in mind, he in various meetings exhorted Vikram, A-3 and others to resort

to armed revolution and even deputed them to procure arms. The planed

conspiracy came to be executed on March 20, 1975 by them.

142.         A-1 and A-3 had clear and strong motive of vengeance in

committing the crime and this can be taken an incriminating circumstance

under Section 8 of the Evidence Act.
(G)          Circumstances against A-2 to prove conspiracy / A-2's
             involvement

143.         Now let us analyse the evidence against A-2 that is sought to

be relied upon by the prosecution. Charge against A-2 was that on or

about March, 18, 19 & 20, 1975, he hatched conspiracy with Vikram @

Subir @ Jaldhar Dass (since turned approver), A-1 and A-3 at Delhi and

other places to commit the murder of CJI. At the outset, it may be

mentioned that the CBI case hinged upon the following circumstances :
              existant persons to provide escape route to A-1 and A-3.

      3.     False denial of proved facts in 313 statement.
      4.     Motive.
      circumstance. It is unclear as to when on a particular date, CJI was

      shown to A-1 in the Supreme Court by A-2. No evidence emerged

      to infer when A-1 contacted A-2 for this purpose and on which date

      and at what time, CJI was shown. In response to a specific query,

      CBI counsel fairly conceded absence of any evidence to confirm it.

      A-2, a lawyer in Supreme Court had no occasion / reason to take A-

      1 with him solely for that purpose to CJI‟s room. Admitted position

      is that in 1975 or 1976, visits to the Supreme Court did not have

      any restrictions. Anyone concerned or connected with the matter

      could go to Supreme Court unhindered to watch the proceedings in

      open Court. The entry to the Supreme Court premises was not

      regulated as is the practice prevalent now-a-days. The Court room

      of CJI was an ear-marked one. There was no hitch for A-1 who was

      a regular visitor to Supreme Court in connection with various cases

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 159 of 201
        to visit the Supreme Court. Moreoever, if a client or acquaintance

       accompanied an advocate, he had no power to stop him to see the

       court proceedings. No cogent and credible evidence was adduced as

       to when and where CJI was shown. None of the prosecution

       witnesses including PW-Vikram assigned any such overt act to A-2.

       The alleged A-1‟s disclosure to PW-Vikram relied upon in this

       regard is of no significant value. PW-Vikram in certain terms

       exonerated A-2 to be a member of the conspiracy. This innocuous

       circumstance has no intrinsic worth to be taken note and is not an

       incriminating circumstance. There are no allegations if A-2

       apprised A-1 about the vehicle, its registration number etc. in which

       CJI used to travel. The car was targeted without verifying if CJI

       was present in it.

(b)          Circumstance No.2 :

144.         Appreciation of evidence led the Trial Court to conclude that

A-1 and A-3 performed journey on March 25, 1975 after A-2 reserved

berth in a three tier sleeper coach and a seat in a sitting compartment in

the fictitious names of „Pankaj Kumar‟ and „Ramesh Kumar‟, respectively


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 160 of 201
 on March 15 & 21, 1975 vide requisition slips Ex.P23 and Ex.P25. The

Trial Court was of the view that this circumstance confirmed that A-2 had

knowledge of the crime and carried out the job assigned by the co-

conspirators.
145.            This circumstance even if taken correct would not be

sufficient to infer hatching of conspiracy by A-2 with co-convicts.

Undoubtedly, the prosecution produced clinching evidence to establish

reservation of tickets by A-2 in the fictitious names of „Pankaj Kumar‟

and „Ramesh Kumar‟ on March 15 and 21, 1975, respectively, which

facilitated A-1 and A-3 to escape out of Delhi. The prosecution was

however unable to collect credible evidence as to at whose instance the

tickets were reserved by A-2. There is no evidence on record to infer that

these reservations were done at the behest of only A-1. A-1 and A-3 were

not in Delhi on March 15, 1975. Nothing is discernible if A-1 used to

remain in constant touch or contact with A-2. As per Vikram‟s statement,

A-1 had left Delhi after the incident of self-immolation. He avoided his

arrest and was declared Proclaimed Offender. Vikram and A-3 were

arrested for contravention of the prohibitory orders on April 24, 1973.

After release from jail, Vikram went back to Jaipur around June, 1973 and

returned to Delhi in the end of June, 1974. On July 01 or 02, 1974, he was
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 161 of 201
 able to spot A-1 in South Extension market in disquised appearance.

Vikram and A-3 left Patna by Assam Express on March 18, and arrived in

Delhi on March 19, 1975 at about 06.00 P.M. A-1 was already in Delhi. It

is unclear on which particular date and by which mode, A-1 arrived in

Delhi. No evidence emerged if after coming to Delhi on or before March

15,1975, A-1 contacted / instructed A-2 to reserve tickets in unreal names,

and if so, at what time and at which place. The prosecution did not

produce any evidence to ascertain A-1‟s movements after his arrival in

Delhi. It is not the prosecution case that A-1 had stayed with A-2 at his

residence. A-2 has offered plausible / reasonable explanation that A-1‟s

„parokar‟ who used to handle his cases had requested him to get the

tickets reserved for A-1. The reason to reserve tickets in the name of fake

individuals was to conceal A-1‟s identity and consequently his

apprehension by police. Admitted position is that the Government had

already banned the „Organisation‟. Since A-1 was avoiding police,

reservation of tickets in fictitious names cannot be considered an unusual

circumstance.
146.         The crucial aspect is that only „one‟ ticket was reserved in the

name of „Pankaj Kumar‟ on March 15, 1975 for A-1‟s travel to Hawrah

on March 25, 1975. Another ticket for A-3 was reserved on March 21,
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 162 of 201
 1975. As per prosecution, the purpose of reservation of the tickets was to

provide an escape route to A-1 and A-3 who were instrumental in

throwing the hand-grenades on CJI pursuant to the conspiracy hatched by

them. The charges were of hatching criminal conspiracy by all the

appellants and Vikram who subsequently turned approver. None of them

was a suspect on March 20, 1975 and even before the date, investigation

was taken over by CBI. Pursuant to the said conspiracy, the hand-

grenades were thrown by A-1 and A-3 in the car. Vikram who had

accompanied A-3 from Patna on March 19, 1975 had no intention to stay

in Delhi after execution of the plan and he went to Patna by Upper India

Express from Ghaziabad same evening. Had A-2 been aware of the

conspiracy as alleged, he must have booked tickes for Vikram and A-3

also along with A-1 on March 15, 1975 itself. It is unclear as to why no

reservation of ticket whatsoever was done for escape of Vikram who was

equally responsible to execute the planned conspiracy. A-1 and A-3 were

not expected to leave Vikram unprotected in Delhi to expose them on his

arrest. The prosecution has not explained as to why A-2 who allegedly

hatched conspiracy to attack and murder CJI did not get tickets reserved

for escape of Vikram. A-2 was not aware that subsequently Vikram would

turn approver.

 147.         There is no evidence if A-1, A-3 and Vikram were ever seen

in close association with A-2 any time. Admitted position is that A-2

though lived in Delhi never assisted co-convicts in procuring any hide-

outs during their visits to Delhi; he was never asked to procure any arms

or ammunitions to accomplish the mission; he never made available any

weapon to the co-convicts. It is also admitted position that A-2 did not

provide any logistics to the assailants on the day of occurrence. The

prosecution did not ascertain A-2‟s presence on March 20, 1975 when the

conspiracy was executed i.e. whether he was in Supreme Court

performing his duties as a lawyer or was somewhere else. There is no

evidence if A-2 was in touch with co-convicts on the day of incident or

was conveyed the information in any manner about the attempt made on

the life of CJI. Admittedly, none of the culprit went to A-2 for shelter.

Post-event conduct of A-2 does not show if he attempted to abscond from

Delhi. A-2 was not a suspect before A-1‟s arrest. When CBI raided A-2‟s

residence in July, 1975 he was available in the house with his family.

Nothing incriminating was recovered to ascertain his involvement or

participation in the crime. A-2 had no contact or meetings with A-1 and

A-3 any time after the incident.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 164 of 201
 148.          Mere reservation of tickets in the fictitious names by A-2

cannot be taken as conclusive proof of his prior knowledge of the

conspiracy or deliberate participation in it. A-2 never participated or

attended any meeting with co-conspirators in or outside Delhi. Vikram did

not attribute any role to A-2 which in any way furthered the alleged

conspiracy.
(c)           Circumstance No.3 :
149.          Falsity of defence under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was taken

another incriminating circumstance to establish A-2‟s involvement in the

conspiracy. The Trial Court concluded that A-2 denied himself to be the

follower of the „Organisation‟; he admitted his visits to the office of the

„Organisation‟ at D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi, but denied his

acquaintance with A-1 though he represented him as a lawyer in self-

immolation case. In para 112 of the judgment, the Trial Court observed

that the prosecution produced convincing evidence that A-2 was an Anand

Margi at the relevant time and was frequent visitor to D-41, South

Extension Part-I, New Delhi, where A-1 and Vikram used to reside and

work for the „Organisation‟ for Anand Marg Publication. In para (120), it

observed that past association of A-2 with Vikram, A-1 and A-3 interse at

that place and else where, and its denial by A-2 was one of the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 165 of 201
 circumstances in the evidence relied upon by the prosecution to prove the

charge of criminal conspiracy.
150.         A-2 has given reasonable explanation for denial to be Anand

Margi as it was a banned „Organisation‟ at that time and he feared arrest

during Emergency era when MISA / DIR provisions were in vogue. Even

an admission to be the member of the „Organisation‟ per se would not

have strengthened the prosecution case as the „Organisation‟ itself was not

a suspect. It is true that there is ample evidence on record to prove that A-

2 knew A-1 and admittedly, represented him as a lawyer in self-

immolation case. A-2 had no reasons to deny his acquaintance with A-1.

However, mere denial is not enough in the absence of any other

incriminating material showing his knowledge or complicity in the crime.

151.         The object of Section 313 Cr.P.C. is to establish a direct

dialogue between the accused and the Court. The accused has a duty to

furnish an explanation in his statement regarding any incriminating

material that has been produced against him. In a recent case „Phula Singh

Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh‟, 2014 (4) SCC 9, the Supreme Court

observed that „if the accused has been given the freedom to remain silent

during the investigation as well as before the court, then the accused may

choose to maintain silence or even remain in complete denial when his
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 166 of 201
 statement Under Section 313 Code of Criminal Procedure is being

recorded. However, in such an event, the court would be entitled to draw

an inference, including such adverse inference against the accused as may

be permissible in accordance with law.‟
152.         Regarding denial of facts, the Trial Court itself took a

reasonable view in para No. 257 of the judgment and observed :


153.         In „Tanviben Pankaj Kumar Divetia vs. State of Gujarat‟,

(1997) 7 SCC 156, the Supreme Court held :
 154.         In „Sharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of Maharastra‟, 1984

(4) SCC 116, the Supreme Court held :

155.         These denials even if taken as adverse circumstance against

A-2 do not establish his involvement in the conspiracy. A-2 admitted his

visits on rare occasions to D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi, for

participation in its rituals. Failure to admit to be an Anand Margi thus

cannot be used an incriminating factor against him. Mere membership of a

banned „Organisation‟ cannot incriminate a person unless he is proved to

have resorted to the acts of violence or incited people to imminent

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 168 of 201
 violence or does an act in order to create disorder or disturbance of public

peace by resort to imminent violence.
156.         In „State (NCT of Delhi) vs. Navjot Sandhu‟ (supra), Supreme

Court observed that ""....seeking false answers given by him in the course

of examination under Section 313 were not adequate enough to make up

the deficiency in the evidence relating to the conspiracy"".
             S.A.R.Gilani in the examination under Section 313 took the

plea that Shaukat was a mere acquaintance and he had not visited him.

When asked questions about the telephonic contacts giving the numbers

thereof, Gilani feigned ignorance of the telephone numbers of Shaukat

and Afzal by giving evasive answers ""I do not remember"". The Supreme

Court observed „....still the fact remains that he did give false answers

probably in his over-anxiety to wriggle out of the situation. That does not

make an otherwise innocuous factor an incriminating circumstance‟.

Gilani also came forward with a false version that the remark soon after

the incident was made in the context of a domestic quarrel. The Supreme

Court observed ""....We can only say that his conduct, which is not only

evident from this fact, but also the untruthful pleas raised by him about his

contacts with Shaukat and Afzal, give rise to serious suspicion at least

about his knowledge of the incident and his tacit approval of it. At the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 169 of 201
 same time, suspicion however strong cannot take the place of legal proof.

Though his conduct was not above board, the court cannot condemn him

in the absence of sufficient evidence pointing unmistakably to his guilt.""

(d)          Circumstance No.4 :
157.         In para 112, the Trial Court observed that as in the case of A-

1 and A-3, the prosecution produced equally convincing evidence about

A-2, that being a staunch Anand Margi at the relevant time, he too looked

upon Anandmurti as God-Almighty. The Court concluded that ""ït would

be reasonable to believe that Anandmurti‟s dentention and the rejection of

his bail applications by the Chief Justice of India and other Hon‟ble

Judges must have triggered off equally strong feelings in A-2 against the

Chief Justice of India.""
158.         A-2‟s visits to D-41, South Extension Part-I, New Delhi and

his representing some Anandmargies in various cases as a lawyer cannot

be taken to show that he had knowledge or complicity in the crime. The

prosecution was unable to prove or establish A-2‟s motive to join the

conspiracy. The prosecution witnesses have given statements regarding

outburst of A-1 and instigation by him to indulge in armed revolution on

various dates. However, there is no evidence if any time, A-2 exhorted

anyone to have recourse to violence after dismissal of the bail applications
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 170 of 201
 of his „Guru‟. The prosecution was unable to prove any direct association

of A-2 with A-1 in this regard. Gist of the offence is agreement to break

the law. The unlawful agreement and not its accomplishment is the

essence of crime of conspiracy. Mere knowledge or even discussion of the

plan is not per se enough. Those who do not form the requisite intention

cannot be roped in as conspirator on the basis of mere knowledge unless

they commit acts or omissions from which a guilty „intention‟ can be

inferred. The findings recorded by the Trial Court referred above are not

based upon any clinching evidence. These are assumptions. There is no

evidence that at any stage A-2 was agitated over the rejection of the bail.

 Observations of Supreme Court in „Kehar Singh & Ors. vs.

State (Delhi Admn.)‟, 1988 (3) SCC 609, are relevant to note :
160.         It further observed :

          93. In State of H.P. v. Krishan Lal Pradhan, it was
          reiterated that every one of the conspirators need not
          take active part in the commission of each and every
          one of the conspiratorial acts.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 173 of 201
           94. In the case of State v. Nalini, S.S.M. Quadri, J,
          after a survey of case law made the following pertinent
          observations: (at paragraph 662)

          ""In reaching the stage of meeting of minds, two or
          more persons share information about doing an illegal
          act or a legal act by illegal means. This is the first
          stage where each is said to have knowledge of a plan
          for committing an illegal act or a legal act by illegal
          means. Among those sharing the information some or
          all may form an intention to do an illegal act or a legal
          act by illegal means. Those who do form the requisite
          intention would be parties to the agreement and would
          be conspirators but those who drop out cannot be
          roped in as collaborators on the basis of mere
          knowledge unless they commit acts or omissions from
          which a guilty common intention can be inferred. It is
          not necessary that all the conspirators should
          participate from the inception to the end of the
          conspiracy; some may join the conspiracy after the
          time when such intention was first entertained by any
          one of them and some others may quit from the
          conspiracy. All of them cannot but be treated as
          conspirators. Where in pursuance of the agreement the
          conspirators commit offences individually or adopt
          illegal means to do a legal act which has a nexus to the
          object of conspiracy, all of them will be liable for such
          offences even if some of them have not actively
          participated in the commission of those offences.
          XXX                    XXX                      XXX

 96. There is one particular observation made by
          Jagannadha Shetty in Kehar Singh's (supra) case
          which needs to be explained. The learned Judge
          observed:
          ""It is, however, essential that the offence of conspiracy
          requires some kind of physical manifestation of
          agreement. The express agreement, however, need not
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 174 of 201
           be proved nor is it necessary to prove the actual words
          of communication. The evidence as to transmission of
          thoughts sharing the unlawful design may be
          sufficient"".
          The expression 'physical manifestation' seems to be the
          phraseology used in the Article referred to by the
          learned Judge. However, the said expression shall not
          be equated to 'overt act' which is a different concept.
          As rightly stated by the learned senior counsel, Mr.
          Gopal Subramanium, the phrase has reference to the
          manifestation of the agreement itself, such as by way of
          meetings and communications.
 97. Mostly, the conspiracies are proved by the
          circumstantial evidence, as the conspiracy is seldom an
          open affair. Usually both the existence of the
          conspiracy and its objects have to be inferred from the
          circumstances and the conduct of the accused. (Per
          Wadhwa, J. in Nalini's case (supra) at page 516). The
          well known rule governing circumstantial evidence is
          that each and every incriminating circumstance must
          be clearly established by reliable evidence and ""the
          circumstances proved must form a chain of events from
          which the only irresistible conclusion about the guilt of
          the accused can be safely drawn and no other
          hypothesis against the guilt is possible."" G.N. Ray, J. in
          Tanibeert Pankaj Kumar, observed that this Court
          should not allow the suspicion to take the place of legal
          proof.
          98. As pointed out by Fazal Ali, J, in V.C. Shukla v.
          State (Delhi Admn.), "" in most cases it will be difficult
          to get direct evidence of the agreement, but a
          conspiracy can be inferred even from circumstances
          giving rise to a conclusive or irresistible inference of
          an agreement between two or more persons to commit
          an offence."" In this context, the observations in the


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 175 of 201
           case Noor Mohammad Yusuf Momin v. State of
          Maharashtra are worth nothing:
 99. A few bits here and a few bits there on which the
          prosecution relies cannot be held to be adequate for
          connecting the accused in the offence of criminal
          conspiracy. The circumstances before, during and after
          the occurrence can be proved to decide about the
          complicity of the accused. (vide Esher Singh v. State of
          A.P.)

          XXX                     XXX                       XXX

 101. One more principle which deserves notice is that
          cumulative effect of the proved circumstances should
          be taken into account in determining the guilt of the
          accused rather than adopting an isolated approach to
          each of the circumstances. Of course, each one of the
          circumstances should be proved beyond reasonable
          doubt. Lastly, in regard to the appreciation of evidence
          relating to conspiracy, the Court must take care to see
          that the acts or conduct of the parties must be
          conscious and clear enough to infer their concurrence
          as to the common design and its execution. K.J. Shetty,
          J, pointed out in Kehar Singh's case that ""the
          innocuous, innocent or inadvertent events and
          incidents should not enter the judicial verdict.""
          XXX                     XXX                       XXX

           113. ""....If there is proof to the effect that the accused
          played a role, attended to certain things or took steps
          consistent with the common design underlying the

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 176 of 201
           conspiracy, that will go a long way in establishing the
          complicity of the accused, though it is not a legal
          requirement that the conspirator should do any
          particular act beyond the agreement to commit the
          offence.""

161.           In view of the law enunciated above Supreme Court did not

find Shaukat to a party to the „conspiracy‟ along with his cousin Afzal.

The prosecution had relied upon the following important circumstances

against him.

       (1) Taking a room on rent along with Afzal at Christian
           Colony hostel into which Afzal inducted the terrorist
           Mohammed about a month prior to the incident.
           Shaukat used to go there.
       (2) The motorcycle of Shaukat being found at Indira Vihar,
           one of the hideouts of the terrorists which was hired by
           Afzal in the 1st week of December, 2001.
       (3) His visits to Gandhi Vihar house which was also taken
           on rent by Afzal in December, 2001 to accommodate
           the terrorists and meeting Afzal there quite often, as
           spoken to by P.W. 34.
       (4) Accompanying Afzal and Mohammed for the purchase
           of motorcycle by Afzal.
       (5) His frequent calls to Afzal especially on the date of
           attack.
       (6) His leaving Delhi to Srinagar on the date of attack
           itself in his truck with Afzal who carried a mobile
           phone, laptop used by terrorists and cash of Rs. 10
           lakhs.
       (7) The fear and anxiety with which he and his wife
           conversed over phone on the night of following day.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 177 of 201
 162.         The Supreme Court observed :
163.         For the same reasons, S.A.R.Gilani‟s acquittal of the charges

by this Court was affirmed by the Supreme Court despite the fact that

Gilani was on intimate terms with Shaukat and Afzal and was conversing

with them through his mobile no. 9810081228 frequently between the first

week of November and the date of crucial incident. The prosecution had

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 178 of 201
 alleged that Gilani was seen with the deceased terrorists in the house of

Shaukat two or three days prior to 13th December. The Supreme Court

observed ""that there is no evidence to the effect that Gilani was

maintaining personal or telephonic contacts with any of the deceased

terrorists. There is no evidence of any participative acts in connection

with or in pursuance of the conspiracy. He was not connected with the

procurement of hideouts, chemicals and other incriminating articles used

by the terrorists. Speaking from the point of view of probabilities and the

natural course of conduct there is apparent reason why Gilani would have

been asked to join the conspiracy. It is not the case of prosecution that he

tendered any advice or gave important tips / information relevant to the

proposed attack on Parliament. None of the circumstances would lead to

an inference beyond reasonable doubt of Gilani‟s involvement in the

conspiracy.""
164.           In „State vs. Nalini & ors.‟, 1999 (5) SCC 253, A-4 was held

guilty under Section 120B IPC by the Trial Court on the strength of

following circumstances :

          (5) When the news of arrest of A-4 was published
          Sivarasan communicated that fact to. Pottu Omman.
          (6) In Ext.P-1253, a diary, Sivarasan has mentioned
          having paid a sum of Rs. 10,000/- to A-4.
          (7) In Ext. P-439, Sivarasan has mentioned payment of
          Rs. 5,000/- to A-4 (Shankar).""
             The Supreme Court observed :

165.         About A-24 (N.Rajasuriya @ Rangan) who actively helped

the accused to escape, the Supreme Court held :

166.         The circumstances relied on by the prosecution are not

sufficient at all to prove A-2‟s involvement in the conspiracy. No

inference can be drawn with a reasonable degree of certainty that he was

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 181 of 201
 having knowledge of the plan / conspiracy. The scanty evidence does not

justify his conviction. The evidence on record does not bring out a high

level of consciousness qua A-2 in the conspiracy.
(H)          Involvement of A-1 & A-3

167.         The ocular and circumstantial evidence supported by

documentary proof elaborately discussed above coupled with PW-

Vikram‟s statement as approver; and extra judicial confessions, etc. prove

beyond reasonable doubt participation and involvement of A-1 and A-3 in

the criminal acts committed by them which were the result of a carefully

planned and meticulously executed conspiracy. Statement of PW-Vikram,

approver, is of vital importance. Statement made by him is detailed, and

descriptive. He is clear, categorical and has given sequence of events in

great detail with precision. He has satisfied the double test i.e. his

evidence shows that he is a reliable witness and it has received sufficient

independent corroboration as discussed above under various heads which

need no repetition here.
   (i)       Testimony of Police / CBI officials

168.         No ground exists to believe that they were proceeded against

by CBI mala-fide or in any bad faith. It was vehemently urged by the

appellants‟ counsel that the investigation was unfair, biased and tainted.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 182 of 201
 Serious allegations were leveled against CBI officials including DSP

B.R.Puri to be instrumental in the false implication of the appellants. He

urged that from the day CBI started investigation i.e. 30.06.1975, it knew

that A-1, A-3 and Vikram were involved in the attack of CJI. This fact

was entertained by various CBI investigators especially, PW-71

(B.R.Puri), DSP, CBI, who was already involved in the investigation of

various cases relating to the „Organisation‟ including Anand Murti‟s case

and L.N.Misra case. DSP B.R.Puri was absolutely prejudiced against

workers of the „Organisation‟ and therefore, influenced the Chief

Investigating Officer to involve them. Refuting the arguments, CBI

counsel urged that the investigation was carried out honestly, fairly and

transparently. All the relevant facts for the just and fair decision of the

case were brought before the Trial Court. Fairness of the prosecution is

apparent from the circumstance that despite arrest of Gopalji and

Mahender Pratap Singh, they were not prosecuted for deficiency of

sufficient material. Mr.Abrol, who was arrested by Crime Branch of Delhi

Police was discharged when his role was not found in this case.
169.         The witnesses from the Police Department cannot per-se be

said to be untruthful or unreliable. It would depend upon the veracity,

credibility and un-impeachability of their testimonies. In „Tahir Vs. State
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 183 of 201
 (Delhi)‟, AIR 1996 SC 3079, Supreme Court observed „where the

evidence of the police officials, after careful scrutiny, inspires confidence

and is found to be trustworthy and reliable, it can form basis of conviction

and the absence of some independent witness of the locality to lend

corroboration to their evidence, does not in any way affect the credit

worthiness of the prosecution case.'
170.         In the instant case, it is significant to note that in the

searching cross-examination, none of the official witnesses has given

conflicting or evasive statements or shifted his stand. When their

testimonies have not been varied from any spectrum, there are no valid

reasons to discard it. No infirmity attaches to the testimonies of police

officials merely because they belong to the force. In this case, CBI came

into picture at a subsequent stage after the commission of crime on March

20, 1975. CBI was able to reach to the witnesses on the basis of

documentary proof with them. These witnesses including PWs-Charan

Singh, Tilak Raj Bhatia, Shiv Raj Singh, etc. independent witnesses from

public having no personal vendetta with the appellants were associated in

the investigation and they had no ostensible reasons to favour CBI. CBI

succeeded to unearth the deep-rooted conspiracy and collected vital

information which was hitherto unknown to it. None of the CBI officials
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 184 of 201
 had any personal animosity with any of the appellants to falsely implicate

them. Number of witnesses who deposed against the appellants were not

expected to implicate them at CBI‟s instance. Those witnesses were

committed followers of the „Organisation‟ and the appellants were in

close association with them. The prosecution case does not rest on the sole

testimonies of police officials but is based upon various other

incriminating circumstances including the statement of PW-Vikram who

turned approver and deposed against the appellants.

171.         At no stage during investigation or trial or soon thereafter,

any complaint was lodged against any of the CBI officials for their

partisan investigation. No request was ever made for change of any

specific CBI Investigating Officer. There are no sound reasons to

disbelieve the statements of the police / CBI officials. PW-71 (B.R.Puri)

conducted investigation on few dates and his credibility remained

unchallenged in the cross-examination.
   (ii)      Criminal conspiracy

172.         There is clear proof that A-1 and A-3 specifically intended to

accomplish the aims of conspiracy by resort to violence. The law relating

to criminal conspiracy has been discussed extensively in the impugned

judgment and needs no further elaboration. I am in agreement with the
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 185 of 201
 learned Counsel for the appellants that under Section 120 A IPC, offence

of criminal conspiracy is committed when two or more persons agree to

do or cause to be done an illegal act or legal act by illegal means.

Unlawful agreement is the gist or essence of the offence of conspiracy.

The offence takes place with the meeting of minds even if nothing further

is done. It is not in dispute that once the object of conspiracy is achieved,

any subsequent act which though unlawful, would not make the accused a

part of the conspiracy. Criminal conspiracy is generally hatched in private

or in secrecy. It is rarely possible to establish it by direct evidence. The

offence can be proved by adducing circumstantial evidence or by

necessary implication. Both, the existence of the conspiracy and its object

have to be inferred from the circumstances and the conduct of the

accused. Criminal conspiracy is a partnership in crime and that there is in

each conspiracy a joint or mutual agency for the prosecution of a common

plan. A man may join a conspiracy by word or by deed. However,

criminal responsibility for a conspiracy requires more than a merely

passive attitude towards an existing conspiracy. Mere knowledge or

discussion or generation of a crime in the mind of the accused is not

sufficient. Learned CBI counsel agrees that Section 10 of the Evidence

Act has been restricted to the continuance of the conspiracy. Any
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 186 of 201
 statement made by a conspirator after the conspiracy is over or after the

conspirator is arrested by the police, shall be outside the purview of

Section 10 of the Evidence Act.
173.         In   the   instant   case,   the   prosecution   has   adduced

overwhelming evidence coupled with statement of PW-Vikram, who

turned approver to prove various incriminating circumstances. The

prosecution has also relied upon extra judicial confessions. From the

evidence enumerated above, inference can safely be drawn that A-1

developed a feeling that CJI was responsible for the continuous detention

of Baba Anandmurti due to rejection of bail applications repeatedly and

declining to transfer the case. He himself was absconding in the self-

immolation case; had given up his usual dress to conceal identity and

roamed in a disguised appearance. Even his close associates PW-Vikram

and PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia were unable to recognize him at first instance.

A-1 was the kingpin / mastermind of the conspiracy. He developed

unfounded feeling that Baba could not be released from jail having

recourse to legal means and decided to resort to violent means. For that

end in mind, he instigated / exhorted the followers of the „Organisation‟ to

procure arms. In various meetings, in which PW-Vikram and A-3

participated, A-1‟s refrain throughout was to go for armed revolution. He
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 187 of 201
 associated PW-Vikram, the stanch follower of the „Organisation‟, who

from his heart wanted release of Baba to whom he considered incarnation

of God by all means. He put himself at A-1‟s disposal and agreed to do

what he desired; even to sacrifice his life. A-3 was also joined in the

conspiracy. A-3 and PW- Vikram travelled from Patna to Delhi, where A-

1 had already arrived to execute the plan. A-3 carried hand-grenades in a

bag. Evidence has come on record that on March 20, 1975, in the

morning, A-1 shared the minute details of the conspiracy and assigned

specific role to PW-Vikram and A-3 in its execution. They all surveyed

the area in the morning. On March 20, 1975, at about 04.30 P.M., A-1, A-

3 and PW-Vikram played active role to achieve the object of conspiracy.

An unsuccessful attempt was made by them to hurl hand-grenades in the

car in which CJI was travelling. The subsequent acts referred above

further lead to the inference that A-1, A-3 and PW-Vikram were part of

the conspiracy. A-1 and A-3 travelled under fictitious names to leave

Delhi showing unnatural and unreasonable conduct relevant under Section

8 of the Evidence Act.
174.         A-1 had taken assistance of PW-Vikram and A-3 to get

release Baba by illegal means and had exhorted them to procure arms in

various meetings much prior to its execution on March 20, 1975. It is not
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 188 of 201
 necessary to precisely mention the starting point of conspiracy in the FIR /

Charge-sheet as it is difficult to spell out with exactutude the details

relating to the starting point of conspiracy. Nontheless A-1 divulged about

the exact conspiracy and the minute plan how it was to be executed in the

morning of March 20, 1975 to PW-Vikram and A-3. Under Section 120

A, it is not necessary that the agreement to do an illegal act must be

entered into by all the conspirators at the same time. It is not required that

each member of the conspiracy should be a member from the inception of

the scheme. The scheme may be conceived by one person and others may

join or agree to be part of it subsequently. It is not required that every

member of the conspiracy should know the identity of all or other

members of the conspiracy. It is also not necessary for the accused to

know the detailed stages of conspiracy; mere knowledge of main object or

purpose of conspiracy would suffice. In „Vikram Singh vs. State of

Punjab‟, AIR 2010 SC 1007, Supreme Court dealt with a case where the

accused had purchased Fortwin injection and Chloroform. It was held that

since the purchase of these materials was an initial step towards the

commission of the offence, the presence of accused Sonia though not

referred by the witnesses at the time of actual kidnapping would not imply

that she was not a privi to the conspiracy. In the case in hand, A-3 and
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 189 of 201
 PW-Vikram were aware about the conspiracy hatched by A-1 on March

20, 1975, in the morning. Without objecting to it, they voluntarily

participated in it and played their respective role in its execution.
             As discussed above, the prosecution was not able to establish

if A-2 had knowledge of the said conspiracy or had participated in it in

any manner. PW-Vikram and other prosecution witnesses examined by

the prosecution did not attribute any overt act to A-2 in the conspiracy.

   (iii)     Statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C.
175.         A-1 and A-3 did not offer plausible explanation to the

incriminating circumstances appearing against them and did not produce

cogent, reliable and credible defence evidence to falsify / rebut the

positive testimonies of prosecution witnesses. A-1 and A-3 took up the

stand of complete denial of their involvement in the crime and offered no

satisfactory explanation to the incriminating circumstance proved against

them in their 313 statements. There was no occasion for them to deny

every material piece of evidence as well as not to give any explanation

when they were specifically asked for. Despite ample evidence on record

they denied their presence in Delhi on the fateful day or soon before that.

They even tried to implicate prosecution witnesses Tilak Raj Bhatia, Shiv

Raj Singh, Raj Singh as accomplices / conspirators. They did not present
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                   Page 190 of 201
 any specific defence to falsify the positive testimonies of the prosecution

witnesses emerging against them. They gave conflicting suggestions. A-1

in his 313 statement admitted himself to be Editor of the „PROUT‟ while

denying his stay at D-41, South Ext. Part-I, New Delhi. He further

claimed that he did not visit Delhi after he left in March, 1973. He,

however, was conspicuously evasive as to where he used to stay in Delhi

and at what particular place he lived / stayed after March, 1973. He did

not reveal as to where he was on March 20, 1975. He even denied his

acquaintance with A-2 though admittedly he met him in jail on September

10, 1975 and represented him in a criminal case. He alleged that after his

arrest on June 17, 1975 at Patna, he was tortured in several ways. But it is

unexplained as to why he did not lodge any complaint before the Judicial

Magistrate before whom he was produced for remand. No physical injury

was noticed by the Judicial Magistrate on his body. A-1 did not claim that

PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia, PW-Shiv Raj Singh and PW-Raj Singh were their

accomplices and had deposed against them at CBI‟s instance or they were

defectors.
176.         Similar are the evasive replies of A-3. He also came up with

the plea that after he left Delhi at the end of 1970, he never returned there.

He too did not divulge where he lived thereafter and where was his
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                  Page 191 of 201
 residence or place of job on March 20, 1975. He admitted his

acquaintance and familiarity with PW-Tilak Raj Bhatia and PW-Vikram;

his arrest along with PW-Vikram on July 24, 1975 at Bhagalpur. He did

not reveal how and for what purpose he was with Vikram. He also never

lodged any complaint to Judicial Magistrate for alleged physical and

mental torture during custody. None of them examined any witness in

defence to prove „alibi‟.
   (iv)      Acquittal of Ram Nagina Prasad

177.         Learned counsel for the appellants urged that similar charge

under Section 4 (b) Explosive Substances Act 1908 was framed against

Ram Nagina Prasad who has since been acquitted. By no stretch of

imagination, the said charge can be deemed to have been proved against

A-3 since his presence at Icchapur (West Bengal) has not been proved at

all. It would be risky to rely on the same set of evidence to base

conviction of the appellants. Case of the appellants cannot be decided on

any other scale and they should have been treated at par for giving benefit

of doubt.
178.         Acquittal of co-accused Ram Nagina Prasad would not

automatically lead to the acquittal of the appellants. Since the evidence

against Ram Nagina Prasad was lacking he was acquitted of the charges.
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 192 of 201
 So far A-1 and A-3 are concerned, they stand on different footings. In

their case, the prosecution has produced clinching evidence to establish

their guilt whereby in the execution of the conspiracy, they threw hand-

grenades Ex.A-3 and Ex.A-4 along with their associate PW-Vikram on

March 20, 1975 in an unsuccessful attempt on the lives of occupants of

the car. It was specifically mentioned / disclosed in the charges framed

against them that they threw „hand-grenades‟. It is reasonable to infer that

they were in possession of the explosives without licence illegally soon

before using in the attack in Delhi. Apparently, omission to set out the

said charge distinctly is inconsequential as no prejudice is shown to have

caused to the appellants. The appellants were aware of the substance of

the charge from the very inception. Neither the appellants were misled nor

any prejudice, which has occasioned in failure of justice, has been caused

to them. Moreover, no such plea was taken before the Trial Court any

time. They never objected to the charges framed against them. At no stage

during trial, they complained of any prejudice. Error in the charges about

possession of Explosives only at Ichhapur and not in Delhi also is not

fatal. They can be held liable for being in possession of the explosive

substance. The charge in question contained two heads, one relating to


Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 193 of 201
 possession at Icchapur and other use of explosives on March 20, 1975 at

Delhi.
179.         Merely because some of the accused persons have been

acquitted, does not lead as a necessary corollary that those who have been

convicted must also be acquitted. If after sieving the untruth or

unacceptable portion of the evidence residue is sufficient to prove the

guilt of the accused, there is no legal impediment in convicting a person

on the evidence which has been primarily disbelieved vis a vis others. It is

always open to the Court to differentiate the accused who had been

acquitted from those who were convicted. Acquittal of some of the

accused does not necessarily result in acquittal of the rest. Hence,

acquittal of Ram Nagina Prasad for the reasons in the impugned judgment

is of no benefit to the appellants against whom the prosecution has

produced credible evidence to the hilt.
(m)          Conclusion

180.         In the light of above discussion, I am of the view that the

prosecution has successfully proved beyond reasonable doubt all the facts

and circumstances by convincing evidence which directly point towards

the involvement of A-1 and A-3 in the conspiracy to make an attempt on

the life of CJI. The conclusion of guilt of A-1 and A-3 is fully established
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 194 of 201
 and all the facts and circumstances so established are consistent with the

hypothesis of their guilt. The proved facts and circumstances completely

form a chain which go only to prove that A-1 and A-3 had committed the

crime and there is no other hypothesis except indicating that the A-1 and

A-3 conspired to commit the murder of CJI and in pursuance to the same,

they attempted on his life on March 20, 1975 by throwing hand-grenades

in his car. From the evidence, it is proved beyond doubt that only one

view is emerging and it is that the A-1 and A-3 were guilty of committing

the offence. Minor discrepancies, exaggerations and improvements

highlighted by the appellants‟ counsel do not shake the basic structure of

the prosecution case in the presence of overwhelming evidence against

them. These so called lapses cannot be allowed to defeat the course of

justice. No major lacuna in the investigation which was not restricted to

Delhi was noticed. Attempt has been made to suggest that all witnesses

including police officials, CBI personnel, experts and followers of

„Organisation‟ had conspired against the appellants and they have been

falsely implicated. No reason exists to draw such a conclusion. It is

unbelievable that everyone would need without any ulterior motive to

implicate the appellants in a false case.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                              Page 195 of 201
 (I)           Sentence order

181.          Coming to the sentence order, Section 31 Cr.P.C. vests

discretion in the Court to direct that the punishment shall run concurrently

when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more offences. The Court

may sentence the accused for such offences to the several punishments

prescribed therefor, which such Court is competent to inflict.         Such

punishments would consist of imprisonment to commence the one after

the expiration of the other in such order as the Court may direct subject to

the limitation contained in Section 71 IPC. In terms of Section 31 (2)

Cr.P.C. wherever the Court awards consecutive sentences, it shall not be

necessary for the Court to send the offender for trial before a higher Court

on the ground that the aggregate punishment for the several offences is in

excess of the punishment which it is competent to inflict on conviction of

a single offence. This, however, is further subject to the proviso to Section

31 (2) of the Code. The aggregate of the various sentences imposed in one

trial is subject to two kinds of maximum limits :
       (i)    It should not exceed fourteen years.
       (ii)   It cannot exceed twice the maximum awardable by the

              sentencing Court for a single offence.

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                 Page 196 of 201
 182.         In „Chatar Singh vs. State of M.P.‟, AIR 2007 SC 319,

rigorous imprisonment imposed on the accused for twenty years in

aggregate was set aside. The Supreme Court held that „provisos appended

to said Section (Section 31) clearly mandate that the accused could not

have been sentenced to imprisonment for a period longer than fourteen

years.‟
183.         In a recent case „Duryodhan Rout vs. State of Orissa‟ in

Crl.A.Nos.2277-2278 of 2009 decided on 01.07.2014, the Supreme Court

relied upon „Chatar Singh vs. State of M.P.‟ (supra) and held that Section

31 of Code of Criminal Procedure relates to sentence in cases of

conviction of several offences at one trial. Proviso to sub-Section (2) to

Section 31 lays down the embargo whether the aggregate punishment of

prisoner is for a period of longer than 14 years.
184.         This question also came up for consideration in „Zulfiwar Ali

vs. State of U.P.‟, All LJp.1181 para 25, in which it was observed :
185.         This Court in „Vikram Kumar vs. State of NCT of Delhi‟,

Crl.A.No. 36/2011 decided on 06.05.2013 held :
186.         In the instant case, sentence order reveals that sentences

enumerated at Nos. (ii) to (vi) were to run concurrently but only after A-1

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 198 of 201
 and A-3 had served out the sentence mentioned at No.(i). Obviously, the

aggregate sentence awarded comes to 17 years which is not permissible.

Accordingly, sentence awarded to A-1 and A-3 under Section 120B (1)

read with Section 115 IPC enumerated at No.(i) is reduced to RI for 4

years.
187.         Considering the gravity of the offence whereby sinister

attempt was made on the life of the CJI in a well-planned conspiracy with

the use of highly sophisticated explosives (hand-grenades), the convicts

(A-1 and A-3) deserve no leniency. Fortunately, the hand-grenades did not

explode and a huge tragedy could be averted. The dangerous mission on

accomplishment would have resulted in heavy casualties. Justice demands

that Courts should impose punishments befitting the crime. Measure of

punishment must depend upon the atrocity of the crime. There is no space

for any leniency and prayer for that is misplaced. Despite claiming to be

followers of the „Organisation‟ which did not preach violence, the

convicts indulged in the most foul and senseless murderous attack /

assault on CJI.
 In „Kehar Singh vs. State (Delhi Administration)‟ (supra), the

Supreme Court observed :

Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                               Page 199 of 201
             Long pendency of a matter by itself would not justify lesser

sentence or acquittal under Section 482 Cr.P.C. as urged.

(J)          ORDER

188.         In the light of above findings, benefit of doubt is given to A-

2. A-2‟s appeal is accepted and he is acquitted of the charge. Conviction

and sentence under Section 120 B IPC is set aside.
189.         While maintaining and confirming the findings on conviction

qua A-1 and A-3 under Section 120B (1) ; Section 307 IPC and Section 4
(b), Explosive Substances Act, 1908 as recorded by the Trial Court,

sentence order is modified to the extent that sentence under Section 120B

(1) read with Section 115 IPC will be four years instead of seven year.

Other terms and conditions of the sentence order dated 01.11.1976 are left

undisturbed. Sentences enumerated at Nos. (ii) to (vi) shall run
Crl.A.Nos.443/1976 & 436/1976                                Page 200 of 201
 concurrently after A-1 and A-3 serve out the sentence enumerated at

Sl.No.(i) in the impugned judgment.
             The appeals filed by A-1 and A-3 are disposed of in the

above terms. Pending application (if any) also stands disposed of. Trial

Court record be sent back forthwith with the copy of the order.

             A-1 and A-3 shall surrender before the Trial Court on 21st

August, 2014 to undergo the remaining period of substantive sentence.

    (39) It is also evident that Mohd. Khaleel (PW-3) also stated before the trial court that on the date of incident, he was working in the agricultural field of Pawan Kumar along with the children since 09:00 a.m. to 05:30 p.m. and in between 01:30 - 02:00 p.m., accused-appellant passed nearby the field in which he was working and went in the grove of Pratap Singh; and he also stated that the grove of Pratap Singh is situated 150 mt away from the field in which he was working and when the body of the deceased was found, then he also went to the place of incident but he did not speak to the informant about the aforesaid incident. On the next date he stated to the Investigating Officer that Ubhan Yadav was going towards the grove of Pratap Singh. The relevant para of the statement of PW-3 is reproduced as under:-
    (43) As it is evident that the postmortem of the deceased was conducted by Dr. Brijesh Kumar Srivastava (PW-4) and Dr. Shipra Singh (PW-5) and seven ante-mortem injuries were found on the body of the deceased, and it is also evident from the postmortem report (Ext. Ka-3) that no ante-mortem injury was found on the genital parts of the deceased as the hymen was torned and Vagina admits two finger; and PW-4 deposed that no injury was found either on the thigh or in the genital part of the deceased; PW-4 also stated that accused was medically examined and smegma was found present with abrasion in blue and black color over the glans  and he opined that there is a possibility that due to intercourse with a minor such injury may occur on the genital part of the accused due to friction and that the above injury was two and a half to three days' old, but on the other side PW-5 Dr. Shipra Singh opined that hymen was torn and two fingers admit in vagina, therefore, it shows that abrasion found on the Genital of the accused-appellant do not support the prosecution case, in case vagina of the deceased was narrow then injuries must be also there.
 (44) Report of the Forensic Science laboratory was discussed by the trial court at page 20-21 of the judgment and mentioned that neither any semen nor any spermatozoa was found. As it is evident from the medico-legal report of the accused-appellant that smegma was present, therefore, in case, the offence was committed by the appellant then the spermatozoa was to be found in the FSL report, but the same was not found; and with regard to the matching of the semen, we find it from Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence, 2nd Edition (1965) as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishan Kumar Malik vs. State of Haryana (2011) 7 SCC 130 that spermatozoa may retain vitality (or free motion) in the body of a woman for a long period, and movement should always be looked for in wet specimens. The actual time that spermatozoa may remain alive after ejaculation cannot be precisely defined, but is usually a matter of hours. Seymour claimed to have seen movement in a fluid as much as 5 days old. The detection of dead spermatozoa in stains may be made at long periods after emission, when the fluid has been allowed to dry. Sharpe found identifiable spermatozoa often after 12 months and once after a period of 5 years. Non-motile spermatozoa were found in the vagina after a lapse of time which must have been 3 and could have been 4 months. Had such a procedure been adopted by the prosecution, then it would have been a foolproof case for it and against the accused-appellant and the Hon'ble Supreme Court also observed in the aforesaid decision that after incorporation of Section 53-A in Cr.P.C. w.e.f. 23.06.2020, it becomes necessary for the prosecution to go in for DNA test in rape cases, facilitating the prosecution to prove its case against the accused, but in the present case, neither DNA test was examined by the prosecution nor the report of FSL support the prosecution case. The relevant part of the judgment delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishan Kumar Malik vs. State of Haryana (supra) is reproduced as under:-
            	Had such a procedure been adopted by the prosecution, then 	it would have been a foolproof case for it and against the 	accused-appellant.""
    (45) The Investigating Officer placed before the trial court the confessional statement of the accused-appellant and also alleged recovery of notebook. In this regard, we find that Section 25, 26 & 27 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides the law on admissibility of confession statements under Indian law. They provide as follows:-
    (46) These provisions reflect the constitutional safeguards provided under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India, which states that no accused of an offence shall be compelled into being a witness against himself.
 (47) The Sections, read with article 20(3) of the Constitution of India make it amply clear that a confession made by any person to a police officer is inadmissible as evidence, except for the singular cases where such statement results in a consequent discovery of fact. It is also not res integra that confessional statements made to the police by the accused cannot be a basis to prove the guilt of the accused. [Aghnoo Nagesia v. State of Bihar, AIR 1966 SC 119, Vsanta Sampat Dupare v. State of Maharashtra, (2015) 1 SCC 253, Ishwari Lal Yadav v. State of Chhattisgarh, (2019) 10 SCC 437].
 (48) In the case of State of UP v. Deoman Upadhyay, AIR 1960 SC 1125, a constitution bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court explained the idea behind Sections 24-27 of the Act:
 (53) In Charandas Swami v. State of Gujarat, (2017) 7 SCC 177, the Hon'ble Apex Court summarized the principles under Section 27:
    (59) This was the reason for giving wide powers to explore very avenue and discover the truth to the presiding judge. The Court further observed that the Court therefore had to actively participate in the trial to elicit the truth and to protect the weak and the innocent, at the same time balancing the fact that it must not assume the role of the prosecutor. Using Lord Dennings' words, the Court in the preceding decision held:
 (60) This has been reiterated in State of Rajasthan v. ANI, (1997) 6 SCC 162, where the Hon'ble Apex Court yet again held that it was the power and duty of the trial court to put any question to the witnesses and the parties at any point in order to ascertain the and discover the relevant facts. The power given under Section 165 of the Evidence Act was intended to be an unbridled power to the courts only for the reason that necessity for eliciting the truth is primary in a criminal trial.
 (61) As we find that the charges were framed by the trial court on 30.07.2013 and on the same day, the learned Amicus Curiae was appointed to defend the accused-appellant, which reveals that at the time of framing of charges, learned Amicus Curiae was not in position to place his submissions, as no time was given to him by the court below as provided under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. It also reveals from the record that learned Amicus Curiae did not make any request for time for placing his submissions, therefore, the legal aid provided to the accused-appellant by the trial court was not real and effective. As it is held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Anokhilal Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (supra) that the legal aid provided to the accused person through Amicus Curiae must be real and effective.
    (62) As we also find that the prosecution tried to develop a case that the abrasions found on the Prepuce and Glans (Genitals) of the accused-appellant is due to intercourse with the child having very narrow vagina; in case, the prosecution case is admitted that the injury on the genital part of the accused-appellant is caused due to rape with the minor having small vagina, then as per the Modi's Medical Jurisprudence & Toxicology, 22nd Edition, an abrasion or laceration may be discovered on the Prepuce or Glans penis, but more often on the fraenum, due to forcible introduction of the organ into the narrow vagina of a virgin, especially of a child, but it is not necessary that there should always be marks of injuries on the penis in such cases; bruising and laceration of the external genitals may be present with redness, tender swelling and inflammation; in nubile virgins, the hymen, as a result of completed sexual intercourse, is usually lacerated, having one or more radiate tears, (more so in posterior half) the edges of which are red, swollen and painful, and bleed on touching, if examined within a day or two after the act. These tears heal within five or six days and after eight to ten days, become shrunken and look like small tags of tissue. But  in the present case, no such injury is found on the genital parts of the deceased rather PW-5 Dr. Shipra Singh opined two finger admits in vagina of the deceased, therefore, the prosecution story is doubtful.
    (63) The other point that the prosecution relied are the statements of circumstantial witnesses namely Prem Nath Singh (PW-1), Vinay Prakash (PW-2), Mohd. Khaleel (PW-3) and Smt. Siyavati (PW-7) that the victim, on the date of incident, went out from her house at 02:00 p.m. and it is undisputed that Vinay Prakash (PW-2) has seen the accused-appellant, on the date of incident, in between 02:00 - 02:30 p.m., coming back from the grove of Pratap Singh; and Mohd. Khaleel (PW-3) has admitted that he was in the agricultural filed which is 150 mt away from the place of incident since 09:00 a.m. to 05:30 p.m., but he has not deposed before the trial court that either he saw the deceased or heard her crying. Therefore, the prosecution story is also doubtful.
    (64) As after amendment in the year 2006, under Section 53 A of Cr.P.C. it is obligatory on the part of the prosecution to get the DNA test to nab the actual culprit, but in the present case, the pubic hair and nails of the accused-appellant and two slides of vaginal smear of the deceased along with her pubic hair were also sent for pathological examination but the DNA test was not requested by the Investigating Officer.
 (65) It is also relevant to mention here that the Forensic/Pathological examination of Vaginal smear of the deceased was done by the FSL, Lucknow who in turn sent a report which was taken into record by the trial court on 14.03.2014 and on this report, number B31/2 was introduced but it was not exhibited; even then the trial court considered in the judgment and observed that even no semen or spermatozoa was found, but in the injury alleged, abrasion was found on the genital part of the accused; and the accused-appellant was also seen by the Mohd. Khaleel (PW-3) in between 02:00 - 02:30 p.m. at the place of incident, when he was going towards the village from the place of incident, therefore, the accused-appellant is guilty; but the learned trial court failed to consider the fact that in case, no spermatozoa is found in the FSL examination of slides of vaginal smear then it was obligatory to conduct the DNA test; and the Investigating Agency also failed to comply the mandatory provisions of Section 53A of Cr.P.C. (amended in year 2006) as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishan Kumar Malik vs. State of Haryana (supra), therefore, the prosecution story is not reliable in relation to the manner in which alleged offence has been committed.
    (66) As in the case of minor discrepancies found in the investigation, Appellate Court does not interfere in the judgment of trial court but in such a heinous offence, the investigation was done in very casual manner as on the date of incident, the inquest was done in the night in the light of seven petromax and head light of one tractor, and in the inquest report nothing is mentioned in the box that whether any article/item was found at the place of incident, near the body of the deceased, but on the next date, the site plan was prepared and the recovery of pair of leggings, under garments and sleepers of the deceased was shown and on the next date, after arrest of the accused-appellant, recovery of notebook of the accused is shown on the basis of his confessional statement, but the same was not sent to FSL for examination of hand writing of the accused-appellant; and the Investigating Officer also committed blunder by not requesting the DNA test as prescribed by Section 53A of Cr.P.C. (amended in the year 2006) are major lapses. In the case of Sunil Kundu and Another vs. State of Jharkhand reported in 2013 (4) SCC 422, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that on the grant of minor lapses or irregularities in investigation acquittal is not permitted but major lapses those impact on the case of the trial cannot be ignored. The relevant para of Sunil Kundu and Another vs. State of Jharkhand (supra) is as under :-
 As the Hon'ble High Court in Criminal (Capital) Appeal No.5298 of 2015 (Vinod and Another vs. The State of U.P.), vide its judgment and order dated 17.02.2017 issued a direction to the State to make investigation of criminal case more effective, reliable and flawless. The relevant part of the judgment in the case of Vinod and Another vs. The State of U.P. (supra) is reproduced as under:-
    (67) As it is also evident that the statement of the accused-appellant under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was taken by the trial court by framing eleven questions on 08.08.2014, but prosecution evidence available on record was not put to the accused-appellant properly; as in Question No.1, it is not mentioned that the deceased went out from her home at 02:00 p.m on the date of incident, in Question No.2 it is mentioned that on the date of incident at about 02:30 p.m., PW-2 Vinay Prakash has seent the accused-appellant coming out from the grove in question and in the Question No.3, in relation to the deposition of PW-3 Mohd. Khaleel, in which time is not explained properly and it is also not stated that he was working in the agricultural field since 09:00 a.m. to 05:30 p.m., and in question no. 3 this fact was not mentioned which is most relevant in the identical manner, and other questions based on deposition of other witnesses are having major lapses. The contents of statement of accused-appellant recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. prepared by the trial court and the reply of the accused-appellant, who was represented by the Amicus Curiae, in relation to them is as under:-
 Satbir Singh & Another vs. State of Haryana (supra)
 
        	""22. It is a matter of grave concern that, often, Trial Courts 	record the statement of an accused under Section 313, CrPC 	in a very casual and cursory manner, without specifically 	questioning the accused as to his defense. It ought to be 	noted that the examination of an accused under Section 313, 	CrPC cannot be treated as a mere procedural formality, as it 	is based on the fundamental principle of fairness. This 	provision incorporates the valuable principle of natural 	justice- ""audi alteram partem"", as it enables the accused to 	offer an explanation for the incriminatory material 	appearing against him. Therefore, it imposes an obligation 	on the part of the Court to question the accused fairly, with 	care and caution. The Court must put incriminating 	circumstances before the accused and seek his response. A 	duty is also cast on the counsel of the accused to prepare his 	defense, since the inception of the trial, with due caution...""
    (69) Learned trial court has also observed that the deceased was mentally retarded and the accused-appellant is having a bad character but there are no evidence available on record in these regard.
 (70) As the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Case of Reena Hazarika vs. State of Assam (2019) 13 SCC 289 that unlike prosecution, accused is not required to establish defence beyond all reasonable doubt - accused has only to raised doubts on a preponderance of probability. The relevant of the aforesaid judgment is reproduced as under:-
    (71) The Court is conscious of the fact that in the present case, 12 years' old girl has been sexually assaulted and done to death by throttling, but the fact remains that whether it was the accused-appellant who has committed the alleged crime appears to be doubtful. In such circumstances, the Court comes to the conclusion that the manner in which the prosecution tried to establish the execution of crime is doubtful. Hence, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The incident does not appear to have happened in the manner in which the prosecution want the Court to believe it had happened. Therefore, the accused-appellant becomes entitle for the benefit of doubt and the appeal deserves to be allowed. 
 (72) For all the aforesaid reasons, we allow the Criminal Appeal No. 1202 of 2014 filed by accused-appellant Ubhan Yadav @ Abhai Kumar Yadav and set aside the judgment of conviction dated 29.08.2014 passed by Shri Satya Prakash Naik, Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.1, Barabanki in S.T. No.266 of 2013 arising out of Case Crime No.101 of 2013, under Sections 302, 201 & 376 I.P.C., P.S. Dewa, District Barabanki, in Criminal Appeal No.1202 of 2014 (Ubhan Yadav @ Abhay Kumar Yadav Vs. State of U.P.).
    (73) The Death reference made by the trial court with respect to the accused-appellant - Ubhan Yadav @ Abhai Kumar Yadav - is also set aside.
    (74) The accused-appellant - Ubhan Yadav @ Abhai Kumar Yadav - is in jail. Let the accused-appellant be released forthwith unless required in any other case.
    (75) It is further directed that the appellant namely Ubhan Yadav @ Abhai Kumar Yadav shall furnish bail bond with sureties to the satisfaction of the court concerned in terms of the provision of Section 437-A Cr.P.C. 
    (76) Let the lower court record along with the present order be transmitted to the trial court concerned for necessary information and compliance forthwith. 
    (77) The party shall file computer generated copy of order downloaded from the official website of High Court Allahabad, self attested by it alongwith a self attested identity proof of the said person(s) (preferably Aadhar Card) mentioning the mobile number(s) to which the said Aadhar Card is linked, before the concerned Court/Authority/Official.
    (78) The concerned Court/Authority/Official shall verify the authenticity of the computerized copy of the order from the official website of High Court Allahabad and shall make a declaration of such verification in writing.

Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.1. This petition and 13 other petitioner filed under Art. 226 of the Constitution raised the question of constitutional validity of s, 44 of the Maharastra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976, being maharahstra Act No. XXVII of 1977 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), which provides  the basis  for determination of amount of acquisition of lands all municipal areas. The petitioners in all these petitions  are owners of lands  either  agricultural of non-agricultural, situated within the municipal areas. It is not necessary torefer to the fact of each of the petition and it would suffice if the facts in the main petition are stated to appreciate the question urged by the rival sides.
2. The land involved in this writ petition bears Survey No., 28 and admeasures 398.60 Hectares and is situated at village Bhushi in Maval Taluka of Pune District. Mohanlal Fakirchand was the owner of this land having purchased ti under the sale ded dated Jan. 18 1966  leaving  behind petition 1 - his widow,, and petitioner 2 to 5 - his childeren /. On August 1, 1978 respondnet 2- Maharastea Housing & ARea DEvelopment Authority - sent a letter to Municipal counsil, Lonavala eliciting information regarding need of local populace for housing accommodation for economically weaker section low income economically weaker, section low income group and middle income group . For the purpose  of  dated August 3, 1978 and Feb. 10 1979 in the local newspaper inviting application for housing accommodation from general public. After having assessed therequirements respondent, 2,by letter date Sept. 15, 1979 conveyed to the State Government its initial requirement of the area of about 26 Hectaresfor the purpose of proposed social housing scheme  to be developed within the limits of Lonavala Municipal Counsil, and requested the Government to publish notification under the provisions of S. 41(1) of the ACt. The proposal was precessed by the Public ?Works and Housing Department and the STate Goverment published a notice under the proviso to s. 41(1) of the Act and the notice was published in the Government  Gazette on Aug. 30, 1979 inviting objections to the propsed acquisition. In pursuance of this notice, petitioner 3 lodged his prootest on Sept. 6 1979. After considering the various the objections including that of petitioner No.3 the State Government published the final notification under sub-section (1) of S. 41 of the Act in the Maharashtra Government Gazette  dated JUly 3, 1980 acquiring certain lands, including that of the petitioners. Sub-sec. 41 prescribes that the land shall, on and from the date on which the notificatiion is published , vest absolutely in the State Government free from all encumbrabces. In DEc. 12, 1980, the notice was issued under sub-section (1) of s. 42 of the ACt to the landholders to surrender and deliver possession to the Collector of Pune within a period of thirty days. In Jan 1981, the petitioner lodged their objection on the  ground that Survey No. 28 of village Bhushi was not includued in the notification published in the Gazette, as survey No.28 described is of village Maval. In puprsuance oto the objection lodged by the petitioner of May, 15, 1981 the State Government published a corrigendum making  the requisite a fresh notice for delivery of possession was issued. The petitioners thereafter filed the present petition in this Court on Dec.17 1981.
3. The petitioner claim that there was no material before the State Government to exercisse powers under s. 41 of the Act, and therefore, thre notification issued under Section 41 was illegal and bad in law. There is no merit whatsoever in this submission. In along with the showing the area to be acquired after assessing the requirement of the area and also the requirement of the housing accommodation. In view of this  return, it is not possible to hold that exercise of powers by the State Government under Section 41 of the Act was illegal. The petitioner also claim that the notification has been issued in breach of rules of natural justice as the petitioner were never served with any notices. The grievance is that though the predecesspor of the petitioner  Mohonlal died on May 18, 1976 the notices were issued in the nameof deceased Mohanlal land not in the name of the petitioner although their name of the recorded in the Record of Rights. There iis no merit in this submision, because in pursuance of the notice issued unde the proviso to sub section (1) of the S. 41 of the Act on Aug 21, `1979, petitioner 3 appeared before in the Authorities and lodged the protest on behalf of thepetitioner n Sept 6 1979. It is not in dispute that he petitioner not only lodged their objections but participated in the proceedings and were personally heard by the Collector before publiscation of notification under  sub-case. (1) of S. 41 of the ACt acquiring thelands. In the circumstances, the petitioner suffered no prejudice whatsoever because of notices being issued  the name of deceased Mohanlal. Survey No.28 of village Bhushi  was not notified for acquisistion, but this submission was not pressed on May 15, 1981.
4. The main thrust of submission in suport of the petition is that subsection (3) of s. 44 of the petition is that subsecion (3) s. 44 of the ACt is ultra vires ARt. 14 of the Constitution, iiinasmuch as it enables the State Government to disctriminate between one landholder and the other by acquiring in one case under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, and in another under the ACt. The petitioners claim that onApril 25, 1977 when the Legislature enacted the ACt and on Dec. 5, 1977 when the Act was brought in fornce in the entire State of Maharahstra, the poers of the State Legislature to enact laws was subject to Art. 19(1)(f) and ARticle 31 of the Constitution as existed at a that  time. It is claimed that he Legislature had no power either   to impose unreasonable restriction a on citizens right to hold property or to acquire  property on payment of illusory amount in lieu of deprivation of the property. It is further claimed that sec 43 read with sub-section (3) and (4) of Sec. 44 of the Act not only impose unreasonable property, but enables  the State to expreppriate citizen property onpayment of an ilusory amout having of the nexus whatsoever with the value of the acquired property. The petitioner further claim that Section 44 of the Act does not provide just and reasonable procedure for deprivation of the property as is required under Article 300A of the Constitution and as the citizen is deprived of his property without payment of proper amount, the provision relating to payment of amount for thepurpose of compulsory acquisition are violative  of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
5. In answer to the petition, Shankar marytrao Shinde, Oficer on Special Duty, Maharasta Housing and ARea Development Authority, ags filed the return  sworn on March 5, 1982 and in para 2 if the claimed that the statement and submissions made in the return filed in Writ Petition No. 3507 of 1981 are relied upon. The return merely denies that the provision of Section 44 are discriminatory. Respondent 1, State of Maharastra, has not cared to file any return, but the Additional Government Pleader informed the petioner ADvocate by a letter that Respondent No.1 would rely upon the return filed by respondent 2. It is really unfortunate that in a matter of such importance the State should not  the file any return.
6. To aooreciate the contention of Shri singhavi, learned counsel appering in support of the petition, that the provision of the Act providing for determination of amount  for acquisition of lands are discriminatory, it is necessary to make refernce to certain provision of the Act. Chap V. deals with acquisition of land had and disposal of property of the Authority. Section 41 of the Act confers power on the State Government to acquire  land to, enable the Authority constituted under the Act to discharge anyof its function or to carry out any of its proposal plans andprojects SEction 43 of the ACt provides that every person having interest in any land accquired under Chap. V shall be entiled to receive from the State Government , an amount as provided in the Chapter, Section 44 to Section  49 of the Act provide basis for determination of amount for  acquisition  of lands  in Municipal area,  while Section 50 in respects of lands  in rural  areas. Lands in municipal areas are those which are situated within thejurisdiction of any Municipal Corporation or Municipal council while the lands in rural areas those outside  the municipal council. Sub-section (2)  of S 44 provides that the state Government shall pay such maount for the acquisituon of the is owner  determined by agreemetn berween the land owner and the Authority. Sub-section (3) of the Section 44 of prescribes  that where no such agreement can be reached, the amount shall payable an amount of  equal  to one hundred times the net average monthly income actually derived from such hland, during the peirod of five consecutive years immediately preceding the date of publication of the notification referred to in Section 41 of the Act. Sub-section (4) of Section 44 prescribes that the net average monthly income shall be claculated in the manner and in according with the principles set out  in the First Schedule. The First Schedule to the Act requires the Lnad ACquisition Officer to hold an inquiry for determiation of the net average monthly income, leaving the remaining forty per cent of the gross monthly rental towards expenditure which the owner of the land would normally incur for payment of tax, collection charges, income tax workds of repair and maintence etc. It also provides that were any  land has been unoccupied ,. Or the owner has not been in receipt of rent, the gross rent shall would  in fact have derived if the land had beenleased our for rent during the relevant period. Sub-section (6) of Section 44 of the Act provides for an appeal to the Tribunal against the determination by theLand Acquisition Officer of the net average monthly income. The Tribunal , which hears the appeal is one constituted under Cl (I) oif Section 2 of the Maharastra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Re-development) Act, sub-section (7) of Section 44 of the Act gives finality to the order of the Tribunal on appeal and prescribes that the decision of the  Tribunal is not open to question in any court . Section 50 of the Act provides  that in respect of acquisition of the land in rural areas, where the amount could not be determined by agreement, the Sate Government shall refer the case to the Collector, who shall determine the amount for acquisition in accordance with  the Collector. Who shall determine the amount  for acquistion in acccordance with the principle for determine  compensation  laid down in the land Acquistion Act, 1894, and the provision of that Act (including provision of reference  to Court and appeal) shall apply thereto mutatis mutandis as if the land ahsd been acquired and compenastion.  Under the provision of that Act. The Act, therefore, provides that  the amount which the owner of the land in rural area is entitled to receive of r te compulsory acquisition shall be detemined in accordance with the  provision of the Land Acquisition Act, while in cases of lands in the Municipal areas it shall be one hundred derived  during the immediately  preceding the date of publication of the  notification.
7. The basis of for  determination of amount in respect of acquisition of landin Municipal areas and in rural areas is clearly discriminatory. In respect of acquisition of land in the rural areas, the owneer os the lands ae entitled to receive the amont of compenastion to  be determined in accordance with the provision of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984. That enables the owner  to receive the market value whichwould be determined in accordance with the would be determined in accordance with the principles laid down under Section 23 of the  Land Acquisition Act. Section 23 of the Land Acquisition  Act provides that  the Court shall take into consideration the market value the potentiality of the land is always taaaken into account. Even if an agricultural land is acquired  under the Land Acquisition ?Act, while determining compensation , if it is noticed that the land has potentiality to be used as building site then market value of such land would befar in excess than that of the agricultural land. Section 23 also enables the owner of land to claim damages sustained by reason of losing possession standing crops of tres or by severance of land from theother lands of the owner of the damage suffered by reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting the other  compelled to change his residence or place ofbusiness. All these advantages ae available tothe owner of the land if the basis  for determination of the land is in accordance with the provisions of the land Acquisition Act, .In  addition to this, under sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the Land, Acquisition Act. In addition tothis, under Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the  Land Acquisition ACt, the owner is entitled to a sum of  fifteen per cent on such market value as consideration of thecompulsory nature if the  acquisition. This amount of solatium is available porvided the compensation is determined in accordance with the provision of the Land Acquistion Act. The power of the   land situated within the rural areas also gets an advantrage to approach the Civil Court against the determination Officer, while such right is  to the  owner of the land within the Municipal areas. In view of the provisions of s. 44(3) of theAct, the owner of the land in Municipal area is entitled to the amount for compulsory acquisition, which is equal toone hundred times the net average monthly in come derived during the period of vie consective years immediately preceding the date of  publicaiton of the notification.  This net  average monthly income has no relation whatsoever with the market value of the landandis an entirely artificial method of ascertaining the market value. While ascertaingig the net average monthly income, the First Schedule procvides that forty percent of the gross rental should be excluded for the ppurpose of tax and maintenance of the property. And the Act does not give any indication as to why the amount of forty percent out of the gross rental is required to be deducted . In the State maharastra, several Rent Acts and Tenancy Acts are in  excess of whart was prevailing in the year 1940. The rents in the earlier years were mere pittance compared to ahat rent could be chargedin respect of the properties newly constructed, and therefore, the net of average monthly income could byu no stretch of imagination reflect the true value of the property. In respect of agricultrual lands the owner is not entitled to charge more, than the standard rent and determining the compensation on the  basis  of net average monthly income would be very inappropriate method. Shri singavi is right in his submission that  there is no rational or logic a sto why the oweners of thelands in municipal areas should be deproved of the advantage of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, while such right is conferred upon the owner of the lands in the rural areas.
8. Shri Paranjpe, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent 2, submitted that capitalizing rent of number of years purchases is a recognised mode for determining compensation under theprovisions of the Land Acquisition Act. It was urged by the learned counsel that providing that basis for determination of the amount in respect of land ssituated within the Municipal areas, the Legislature was not discriminating between the holders of lands within the Municipal area and outside. It is no doubt true a that capitalizing the rent of number of years purchases is one method addopted while determining compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, but it is an accepted position that it is not quire a  no other method is available. This method is entirely unsafe when the rent is very low. This Court advised capitalization of ground rent at twenty years purchse and in the case of unsecured ground rent  at 16-2|8 years purchase in the decision reported in (1908) 10 Bom LR 907, Government of Bombay v. MOrwanji Muncharji Cama. Though  it isnot possible to be dogmatic regarding unmber of years and it mmsut vary with the condition of the property market and the nature  of the property, it is difficult to appraeciate on what basis the Legislature though  it proper to capitalize the rent equal to o nehundred times of the net average monthly income. Shri Paranjpe submitted that capitalization of rent of twenty years purchases was fixed by this Court with an idea that he interest given by the banks would be equivalent to the profits of the owner  from the property. Shri paranji suggested that as the Bank interest has been raised  from  time to tme, the number of years purchsse must beless than the periood of twenty years. There is nothing on record to support the submission of the learned counsel, and there isno reason why the State Government should not hahve produced the material to  sustain the claim that the amount that the amount ascertained by method of capitalizing number of years purchse was equivalent tothe  market  value of the land whichwould be determined under the provision of the Land Acquisition Act. Shri Paranjpe then submited that as the  amount determined under sub-section (3) of the S. 44 is not illllusory, it is not open for the petitioners to challenge the validity of the Section on the ground of discrimination. It was urged that there is no rule that in  every acquisition, compensation must  be ascertained accordeing to the provisions of the aland Acquisition Act,. The submission is that it is open for the Legislature to provide any other  basis for determination of compensation and it is not permissible to make any grievance of the Legislature adopts such a course. In support of the submission reliance is place on the  decision of the sSupreme Court reported of the submission, reliance is placed on the decision of the Supereme Court , State of Gujara v. Shantilal Managldas . In the case before the Supreme Court, it was claimed that the Government by acquiring the porperty for the public purpose under the provision of the Bombay Town Planning ACt avoided to pay the compensation under the Land Acquisition Act and that in fringes ARt. 14 of the Constitution, inasmuch as for one public purpose the lands are acquired under the Land Acquisition under the Town Planning ACt, whch deprives the owner of certain advantages under the Land Acquisition ACt. The Supreme Court in  para 54 of the Judgemet found  that  there is no option under the Bombay Town Planning ACt , no acquire the land either under the Land Acquistion ACt or under the Town Planning Act and as there is no option, the contention that the provisions for acquisition under the Town Planning for acquisition under the Town Planningg ACt are invalid on the ground that tey deny eqaul protection under the laws, must stand rejected. The decision of the supreme Court has no application to the facts of the present cse of as the  present ACt provides for different basis for determination of amount for acquisition of lands. The Act prescribes one rule for the lands situated in rural areas whwile other in respect of the lands within the Municipal areas. The principle laid down by the Supreme Court would have application provided the basis for dtermination of the amount wassame for all the lands wherever  they are situatede and then the grievance is made that the advantage of the Land Acquisition of Act  is denied.
9. Shri Paranjpe then submitted that the lands in Municipal areas and land in rural areas are two distinct classes and therefreo the discriminaiton while determining the amount for acquisiion of lands is permissible. The submision is not accurate, because, it is not sufficient that there are two distinct classes, being the lands in municipal areas and the land in rural areas, but the  discrimination is permissible provided is it has some nexus to the object to be achieved. The object to be achieved is deteminaion of the amount for the compulsory acquisition of the land and it is not possible to accept the submission that the discrimination made in respect of providing different basis  for  determination of amount is valid Shri Paranjpe submitted that the Constituted itself makes classification between the agricultural lands and non-agricultural lands and makes reference to the Second Proviso to Article 31A of the Second Constitution. The proviso issues a fiat to the State not to acquire any agricultural land held by person under his pwesonal cultivation and within the ceiling limit unless the law relating to acquistion of such land provides for payment of compensation at the rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof. The learned counsel submitted that the lands in the rural area are mostly agricultural while in the municipal area there is harldy any agricultural  basis for determinaiton of amount for acquisition of land in the two areas, the Legislature wisely provided different  modes. The submission cannot be accepted, because the assumption that there are hardly any agaricultual  lands  inteh Municipal are is without ay basis. The State Government has not produced any satistics or material on record to establish that the landss within the municipal area are olny non-agricultural lands, while on the other hadn it is common knowledge that there are large tract os  agricultrual lands  within the Municipal area. The limits of the Municipal areas extend far beyond the developed twon and are determined by taking into consideration the development in future and also for fixing the octroi limits . In this group of petion certain pertitioner are holders of agricultrual  lands within the  municipal  aera and also personally cultivating thelandsa and the area held by then is within the ceiling limit. In these  circumstances, it is not permisible to accept the broad submision of the learned counsel that tere are hardly any agricultural land in  the Municipal area, of  the lands in the rural  ara are mostly agricultual and therefore, the  discrimination is permissible. Infact the protection of Seccond Proviso to ARt. 31A of the Constitution of Section 4 of the Actin respect of holders of such lands are clearly villative of Arts. 31A and 14 of the ?Constitution. In our judgement , the Act clearly discriminates and those of rural areas and such discriminationis clearly violative of Art,. 14 of the constitution.
10. We may refer to some decisionss of the Supreme Court in this connection, and the frst decision is , P Varjavelu Mudaliar v. Acquisition West Madras. the Supreme Court held that the law under the subject of violation of protection under Art. 14 is well settled make a reasonable classification  for the  purpose of legislation the said classifcation has to pass two test,  anmely, (I) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differntia which distinguishes persons and differntia must have a rational relation to  the object sount to be achieved by the statue in question . The Supreme Court on a comparative study of the Land  Aquisition  (Madras Amendment) Act (23 of 1961) found thatif a land is acquired  for housing scheme under the Amending Act, the claimant gets alsser value than the would get for the same land or a similar  land if it is acquired for a public purpose, like  hospital, under the Land Acquisition Act. The Supreme Court held that the classification souhgt to be made by the Land Acquisition (Madras Amendment) Act between the persons whose land  are acquired for other public purposes has no reasonable relation to the object souhgt to be achieved ans the discrimination is writ  large on the Amending Act. The decision in Vajravelul Mudaliar case  was  approved in later deceion of the Supreme Court , Balammal v. State of Madras .The supreme Court found that under  the Madras City Improvement ?Trust Act (37 of 1950), which enables the State to acquire lands for the right to the statutory solatium and that would result into a clear case of  discriminatiion which infringes the guarantee of equal  protection of the law and the provision which is more prejudicial to the owners of the lands compulsorily acquired must be deemed invalid.
11. the next decision of the Supreme Court in reported in AIR 1973 SC 689, Nagpur Improvement TRust v. Vithal Rao. The Supreme Court held that the Legislature cannot  lay  down different  principle of compendsation for lands acquired for a hospital  of a school or Government  building  because the acquisition  in all the three case  are for public purpose and as far as the owner is concerned, it does not matter to  him whether it is for one public purpose or the other. It was further held that the classification based on a public purpose is not permissible under ARt. 14 of the Constitution for the purpose  of determining compensation. The principle was reiterated by the Supreme Court in the Judgement , Om Prakah v. State  of U.P . The last decision of the Supreme Corut is , State of Kerala v. T.M. Peter. The vires of Section 34 of the Town Planning Act (Travanceore Act 4 of 1108) a was challenged on the Constitution as it escluded Section 25 of the  Kerala Land Acquisition Act, which provides for quantification of compensation, including payment of the solatium Mr. Justice Krishna Iyer, speaking for acquisition not discriminaition compensation ; whether you take A's land for improvement scheme of irrigation scheme how can you pay moree or les, guided by an irelevance viz. The particular public purpose? The State must act equally when  it takes property unless thre is betwween two categores of owners having a nexus with the   with the object, namely, the scale of compensation. It is intellectual confusion of constitutional principle to regard classification of  good for one purpose as obliteration of difference for unrelated aspects"". (Underline supplied) The learned Judge referred to the earlier decision of the Supreme Court and concluded in para 19 as follows:
12. Shri Gumaste, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Advocate General, submitted that  even assuming that the provision of Section 44 of the Act are discriminatory, still it is not permissible  to touch them as the protection under Article 19(1) and Article 32 is the available tothe petitioners because those Article were not deleted when the  Legislature passed the legislation still the protection is taken the away by Art. 31C  of the Constitution. Shri singvi had urged that the protectionof ARt. 19(1)(f) and ARticle 31 is available in view  of the decision of the ascertainign whether the protection is available or not is the date on whch the Act came into operation. It is not in dispute that Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31 of  the Constitution were available both and on April 25, 1977  when the Act was passed and on Dec. 5, 1977 when the it came into operation. Article  31C reads as under :
This Article was amended by the Constitution (forty second Amendment) Act 1976, and the words ""all or any or the principle laid down in Part IV"" were substituted for the original words the principle specified in Cl. (b) or Cl ( c) of Art. 39"" with effect from Jan. 3 1977. Shri Gumaste submitted that theAct was enacted to give effect to the policy of the State towards securing the  principle  laid down in Part IV of the Constitution. It was urged that he ACt was enacted for giving effect tothe Directive  Principles  contained in ARt. 48A of the Constitution. To enable him to advance this submission , Shri, Gumaste had to claim that we must read Art. 31C as it exissts today, that is as it a was amended by sec. 4 of the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976, Shri Gumaste in this consnecton submitted and was heartily joined supreme Court in the case of Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India,  is not good law. The supreme Court in the fase of Minerva Mills held that Section 4 of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) ACt is beyond the  amending power of the Parliament and is void since it damages the basis or essential features of the constitution and destroys it  basics structure by  a total exclusiong of challenge to any law on the ground  that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights caontution, if the law is for giving giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing all or any of the principle laid down in part IV of theConstitution. The result of this decision s that the protection of  Art. 31C is available provided the law is for giving effect tothe policy of the State towards securing the principle specified in Cl. (b) of Cl. ( c ) of Art. 39. The validity of Art. 31C which was introduced by the constitution (25th Amendmet) Act, 1971, was considerred by the Supreme Court in the case , Keshavananda Bharati shripadgalvaru V state of Keral, and the latter and part of the Article 31C and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any Court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy was held to be invalid.
13. Shri Gumaste submitted that the decision of the Supreme Court in Minerva  Mills case  (supra) is no good law  for two reasons. First the judgementin Minerva Mills case striking down Section 4 of the Constitution (42nd Amendment ) act was obiter as the  question did not arise for consideration  in that case and did not require determination. The second ground urged is that the decision is no longer a good law in view of the subsequent decision of the supreme Court, , Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company v Bharat Coking Coal ltd. the submission cannot be accepted and both the reasons suggested by the learned counsel are deviod of anymerit. The first submision that the question of validity of Section 4 of the Constitution (42nd  Amendment) Act did not arise for consideration, and therefore, the conclusion is obiter, is without any substance , because the said contention was urged before the Supreme Court by the Attorney General and Additional Solicitor General, and that is noted in para 412 of the Judgement. The Supreme Court in para 43 rejected the preliminary objection ot the consideration of the question as regard  validity of Section 4 of the Constitution (421nd Amendment) Ac,, holding that the question is not an academic or hyporthetical question. The supreme Court then proceded to consider to the validityof the amended ARt. 31C and recorded a conclusion that S. 4 was void and in these circumsatnces it is futile to claim that the decision in inerva Mills to case should be ignored as obiter. The second contention law  that Minerva Mills case is no longer a good Supreme Court as equally misconceived . In Sanjic Coke Manufacturing case  (supra) Mr. Justice Chinnappa Reddy, speaking for the Bench, did not sound some misgivings about MInerva Mills decision, but observed in para 13 of the Judgement:
In face of these observations oof the Supreme Court it is futile  for Shri Gumaste to urge that the decision in Minerva Mills case stands overruled by the later decision. In our judgement , the decision of the Minerva Mills case is binding on us and the protenciton of Art. 31C is availabe provided of law is  made to give effect to the policy of the State toward securing the principle specified Constitution.
14. Shri Gumaste then submits that Article 39(b) which forms part of  Part IV of the Constitution, provided  that the State shall direct its policy towards securing that the ownership and control of  the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good. Article 39(c) requires the State to secure that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and emns of production  to the common detriment. Shri Gumaste submits that theACt was enacted to give effect to the directive principle  contained  in Art. 39(b) and (c) of theConstitution and urged that the expression ""material resources of the Community"" would take in its weeep the lands held by the citizens and the legislation providing for acquisition of such land ot subserve  the common good is entitled to protection under Art. 31C of the Constitution. In suspport of the submission, reliance  is placed upon the decision is in Sanjiv Coke Manufacturing's case  (supra) where the expression ""material resources of the community"" as considered and held not confined to natural resources, to or resources owned by the public, but means and includes all resources, natural and man-made,  public and private-owned. In view of the dictum laid down  by the Supreme Court it cannot be debated tat the  expression  ""material resources of the community"" would cover the lands held by private owners>
15. Now, what are the principles or tests for determining whether Article 31C is attracted in respect of particular legislation? In Minerva Mills  case (AIR 1980 SC 238) for the majority observed that in the very nature of things is it  difficult for a court to determine whether a particular law gives effect to a particular policy. Mr. Justice Bhagwati, in his minority judgement, observed that :
The learned Judge further observed that even where the dominant object of law  is to give efect to a Directive Principle, it is not every provision of the law which is entitled to claim protection. The learned Judge  further observed that the words of Art. 31C of a plain, natural construction do not include all the provision of the law but  only htose which give effect to the Eifective Principle.  The  test laid down in th3e Minerva Mills case by Mr. Justice Bhagwati was approved by the Supreme Court in Sanjiv Coke Mnaufacturing case  (Supra)
16. Bearing in mind the test laid down by the supreme Court, we will examine the provision of the Legislation to find out whether the legislation and the provision contained in Chap V are enacted to secure the directive Principle under Art. 39(b) of the Constitution. The Statement of Object and reasons does not thorw any light to ascertain whether the Legislature intended by the enactment of the Act on to secure Directive Principle unde Art. 39(b) and ( c) of the Constitution. The Act contains no to the Directive Principle. The preamble sets out that there are various corporate and statutory bodies  in the State which have been establshed forf dealing with the  problem of housing accommodation, for repairing  and reconstruting building  in a bad state of disrepair and  presenting a dangerous possibilisty of collapse, and  with a view to intergrating the actaivities of these bodies so as  to provide for  more comprehensive and co-ordinated approach that thee Act has been enacted,. Chapter Ii provides for establishment of the authority and Boards, and four Board at Bomabay, Nagpu, Aaruangabad and PUne areestablished under S. 18 of the Act. Chapter III deals witrh functional duties and powers  of the Authorities  and Board and Section 28 reciiites various functions under the different  groups. The Authority has to prepare and execute proposals, plans or projects and for housing acommodation plans or projects for housing accommodation subject to the provision of the Town Planning Act and Metropolitan Act, Some of the duties are to develop commercial centres and new towns Planning Act, and confers power to sell the lands vested in the Board, expression ""develpopment"" is defined under Section 2(13) and means 'carrying out of building , engineering , mining or other operations in or over,, or undder, any land (including land under  sea , crock, river, lake or any other water) or the making of nay material change in any builidng or land, and includes re-development and lay-out and sub-division of land.' One oof the function is to provide of the ameities in the area within jurisdiction of the Authority na dhteh expression ""amenity"" has been defined under Section 2(1) of  the Act and it means 'road , bridge,any other means of communication, transport supply of water and electricity , any other source of energy street lighting, drainage, sewerage, education and welfare projects, markets and conservancy and any convenience which the State Government may specify to the be an amentity. Sub-section (2) of Section 28  prescribed that in addition  the Authority or BOard may undertake any duties of the Planning Act. Chapter IV deald with Budget, finance, account and audit, while Chap VIII provides for levy of Repairs and Reconstruction cess on the building and it is to be collected by the Municipal Corporation or Municipal Council and to be paid over to the Authority under the Act. Section 93 enables the Authority 96 requires the Authority to pay compensation as provided under Chap. V. Section 97 requires the state Government and the Municipal Corporation of GReater bombay to pay an amount of Rs. 2,40.00.000|- every year to the Authority. Chapter IX deals with environmenttal improvement of slums, and under SEction 209 the Auhtority can issue a declaration  that certain land is a slum a improvement  area. Section 105 enables the Authority to entrust the improvement work of such area to the Municipal Corporation. Chapter XI deals with  the control and Section 164 enables control over the Authority or the Board. SEction 183 repeals the various  Act regarding housing existing in the state of Maharasstra including, Bombay Housing Board Act, 1948. The earlier ACt also provided  for acquisition of thelands but did not make  any discrimination  between the holders of lands in municipal area and the rural area, and the amount was determined in respect of the  all the lands in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act.
17. Considering the provision of the ACt in detail,  we find that the function  duties and powers conferred on the Authorities and the Board are not restricted only to provide housing accommodation to the  needy, but the functions take in their sweep several activities which are normally caried out by the municipalities of the Town Planning  Authorities. The functions of the Auhtorities and the Board are not restricted only to the development of te lands and provided amenities for housing people, but includes commercial activities, whereby the Authorities make profit. The development of commercial centres, which is considered  as a function or  duty of the Authority, is clearly indicative of the fact tahat he legislation is not restricte for only providing the housing accommodation . By undertaking development oof commercial centres, the Authority is expected to make profits which of course would be used for advancing the objects of the Act. In this light if the power to acquire lands is considered, then it is clear that the acquisition is made without reference to the holding  of the owner  unlike Agricultural Lands Ceiling Act or Urban Land Ceiling Act, where the land above certain ceiling is compulsorily acquired for distribution to the land less people. The acquisition of the land under the present act is undoubtedly  for a publci purcharge any of its functions or to carry out achiee the directive principles, that is to distribute the ownershsip and control  of the material resources as best to subserves the common good. The powers under chapter ""V are to be exercised for carrying out a public purpose andit had no bearing whatsoever with the distribution of the assets, like land. The land are not acquired from those who have  got ample and land for  the purpose of distribution to the land less people. The power of acquisition is exercised under Chap V without reference to the holding of the owner or to the nature  of the land. As in the cse of wsome of the petitioner in the present group, the lands sheld by them are agricultral lands which are under personal cultivaton and the holding of the petitioner is not only under the ceiling area butis minimum, and the only source of maintenacnce. In  spite  of this, , it is permissible for the Government ot deprive them of their  lands to subserve the public purpose. The  lands is surely not compulsorily acquired from such  holder for purpose  of distribution, and the Legilature had not even in contemplateion the directive principle contained in Article 39(b) while enacting the provision of acquisition under  Chap. V. In our judgement the true nature  and charater of the Act is to create an authority or a Board to deal with the problem of housing accommodation. Repairing and reconstructing buildings prespenting dangerous possibility of collapse. The object is also to carry out improvemental work in slum areas and incidentally develop the area in a  balanced manner, with suuficient attention  to ecology, pollution, and over crowding. The object in enacting the Lelgislation was obviously to provide wholesome  civic life to the citizen and to achieve and land or buildings in a bad state of disrepair was conferred by the legislation. The principle or diminant object was certainly not to give effect to the Directive Principles, but to provide a separate or independent entity   for carrying out duties and function which are normally  required to be done by the municipal Corporation . With the growth of the cities the problem of housing shortage and musthroom growth of slums has gone beyond imagination of the State Government and the problem cannot be resolved by the Municipal Corporation or the Municipal Counsils with their limited resources and man-power . The  legislation was enacted with a view to take away the burden on the Corporation to  successfully concentrate it s attention on solving those problems and make the life of the citizen  comfortable. It is possible to denote some remote and tenuous connection between the Act and some Directive Principal but as there is no real and substantial connection between the Directive Principles and the legislation, it is not possible to conclude that thee Act is entitled to the  protective shield of ARt. 31C of the Constitution. We have  no hesitation in concluding that the provision about acquisition of the lands contained in Chap. V of the Act are merely subsidiary or incidental to the object of the Act and are not essentially and intergratedly connected with the implementation of the Directive Principles and as such wold not be able to enjoy the protectiion of Art. 31C of the Constitution. Article 31C deprivces the citizen of very valuable fundamental rights it under Arts. 14, 19 and 31, and unless it is found that the dominant object of the Act is to give effect to the Directive Principles, the court should be slow in holding that he legislation was enacted to secure the principles specified  in Cls. (b) and (c) of Art. 39 of the  Constitution. In our judgement, the Maharastra Housing and Area Development Act, V of the Act are not enacted to secure the Directive Principles under Art. 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution, and therefore, the respondents are not entitled to plead that the provisions of the Act under challenge should be upheld even though violative of the fundamentala rights under Art. 14 of the constitution.
18. That  takes us to an interesting argument presented to us about the introduction of ARt. 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII of the Constituion . Shri Singavi submitted that even assuming that the submission urged on behalf of the respondents that the Act is protected by ARt. 31C of the Constitution and the fundamentala rights under Art. 14, 19 and 31 are not available under is correct, still the provision of sub-sec (3) and (4) of Section 44 of the Act cannot stand the scrutiny of Art. 300A of the Constitution. Article 300A provides thatno person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of  law of  and it was urfed dthat the expression ""authority of law"" means sof the law or in other words the law providing for depreivation of the property shall be just, fiair and reasonable. Shri Paranjpe on the other hand submitted and the ably supported by Shri Gumaste, that after deletion of ARticle for deprivaiton of the property. It was urged  that the right conferred on the holder of the  property under Art. 300A is only a legal right and not a fundamental right as earlier available under Art. 31 of the constitution. The submission is that under Article 300A of the Constitution, the Parliament, merely intended that there shall not be deprevcation of the property except by legislation or in other words the Parliament did not desire deprivation only by legislatiom. Shri Paranjpe went a step further and submitted that once the right to hold property and there isn no obligation on the Legislation to pass legislation which is just, fair and reasonable, or to provide for payment of any compernsation or amount for the deprivation of the property. Shri Singavi, in answer to this submission, urged that in spite of deletion of ARticle 31 from the Chapter on Fundamental Rights the pharseology used  in Article 300A is identical with that of Article 31(1) and that is indicative of the fact that the Parliament recognised the doctrine of eminent domain and the obligation to pass legislation, which is just, fair and reasonable is not taken away. ARticle 31(1) and (2), as originally enacted, ran as follows:
(3) In State of Bihar v. maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar singh of Dharbhanga, , it was contended before the Supreme Court that the Bihar Land REforms At, 1950 was invalid for lack of legislative competence since the impugned law was not enacted for the public purpose  and  did not provide for compensation. The submission was that the expresseion ""acquisition"" used in legislative Enrty 3 of the Entry 36 of LIst II and Entry 42 of List III dealing with acquisition and requisistion of property, inter in alia, provieds that acquisition must be for tthe public purpose and there is an obligation to pay the compensastion. The contention was not accepted by the Supreme Court. The Ssupreme Court considred the doctirne of eminent domain applied in the United States in regard to the nature of the States power to acquire private property for public use. The Supreme Court held that as Art. 311(2) of the Constitution  was intention expropriating private property, and the two conditions being requirement of a public purpose and obligaton to pay compensation , it is not necessary to trace the power to the doctrine of eminent domain. Chief Justice Patanjali SAstri observed that under the common law of eminent domain as recognised in tehe jurisprudence of all civilized countries the STate cannot take the property of its subject unless such property is required for a public purpsoe and without compensating the owner  for its loss. Justice Mahajan observed that on the continent the power of compulsory acquisition isdescribed by the them term "" eminent domain"" and the term seems to have been originated in 1625 by Hugo Grotius, who worte of this power in his work ""De jure Belli et Pacis"" as  follows:
19. As mentioned hereinabove, ARt, 300A of the Constitution reproduces verbatim provision of Art. 31(1) and the submission urged is that the doctrine of eminent domain would come into play and though the Government  has power to deprive owner of the property, such power is circumstances by two conditions, being requirement of a public purpose and the obligation to pay compensation. On the other hand, it was claimed that the deletion of Art. 31(2) makes it clear that the property can be compulsorily acquired and  the two requirements need not be present . Article 300A provides that no person shall be deprived of the his property save bny authority of law ans it is imposible to  accede to the submission that the 'authority of law ' can enable deprevation of property save by authority of law and it is impossible to aced to the submission that the 'authority of law' can enabnle deprivation of property for a private purpose. The entire democratic structure of this country is based upon the concept of the rule of law' and it is not possible to  imagine that thelegislation of a private property for a purpose  which  is not a public purpose. Shri Paranjpe reluctantly conceded to that position, but submited that it would not be proper to  import the requirement ot pay compensation oramount while construing the ambit of ARt. 300A when the Parliament in its wisdom decided to delete ARt. 31 from the Chapter on the  Fundamental Rights. It was urged that payment of compensation for compulsaory acquisition of the property has led to considerable debate and produced large case law, and therefore the Parliament thogut it wise to remove the right to property from Part III of the Constitution. The learned counsel drew support for his submission that after the 44th Amendment there is no express provision  in the Constitution requiring the State to pay relying upon the  opinion expressed by Mr. Durgadas Basu on  papge 677 of his 'Shorter Constitutionof India"" Eighth Edition. The view expressed by the learned author is different from the opinion of Mr. Seervai expressed in the book 'Constitutional Law of India Special  Edition , Vol III, 15A , 20A on wards , and by Mr. P. K. Tripathi in his ARticle published in AIR 1980 Journal, page 49 . In our judgement it would be difficult to conclude that by deletion of ARt. 31 from conclude thatby deletion Constitution the Parliament intended to cond\fer absolute right on the Legislature to deprive the citizen of his property by mere passing of a legislation without complying with the requirement that the deprivation with is for a public purpose and on payment of amount which is not illusory. The doctrine of eminent domain really recognises the natural right of a person to hold property, and if that right can be taken away by the legislation without satisfying the two requirements,. tHen the entire concept of rule of law would be redundant. The introduction of ARt. 300A in the Constitution  while deleting Article 31 clearly indicates that the Parliament intended to confer a right on the citizen to hold property and hwich could not be deprived without authority of law,. In our judgement, inspite of deletion of Art. 31, the constitution obligation to pay adequate amount to the expropriated owner is not taken away.
20. Shri singavi then submitted that expression 'authority of law' in Art. 300A requires that the legisaltion providing for deprivation of property must be just, fair and reasonable, and the contrary submission of the respondents that the only requirement of the ARticle is enactmentof the legislation to deprive of  the property and the legislation need to not the be just, fair and reasonable cannot be accepted. The leanted counsel in support of his submission pointed out that Article 21 enable the State to deprive the citizen of his lif or liberty, Art, 265 enables the State to levey and collect the tax and ARt. 300A enables the State to deprive the  citizen of his property, but all these three ARticles provide that such deprivation or levy of tax shall not be except according to the procedure established by law or by authority or law. The expression ""according to the procedure established by law or by authority of law. The  expression  according to the procedure established by law or by authority orlaw has been considred by the supreme Court in (a) large number of cases as the procedure which must be just, fair and reasonable. It is well accepted that if the precedure  which must be just,  reasonable and fair, then the deprivation of the valuable rights of the citizen  coannot be ustained. The decision of the Supreme Court in Gopalan's case  holding that law means enacted law and need not be just and fair was specifically disapproved and  overruled in the decisionof the Supreme Court in  , R.C. Cooper. V Union of India. In this case dealing with challenge to the nationalisation of banks, Mr. Justice J,C. Shah, speaking for the bench , observed in para 62 of the Judgement  that Art, 31(2) requires that property must be acquired for a public purpse and that it must be acquired under the law with characteristics set out in that ARticel, but formal compliance with the conditions under Article 31(2) is not sufficient  to negative the protection of the guarantee or right to property. The learned Judge further  held that (at p. 597):
21. The question as to whether the expression ""authority of law of procedure established by  law or means ""just , fair  and reasonable "" is no longer open to debate in view of te celebrated decision of the Supreme Court , Smt Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India. The passport of Mrs. Maneka Gandhi was impounded in public interest and the Government of India declined in the interst of the general public to funish the reason  for its decision. The action was challenged on the ground that SEction 3(c) of the Passport Act, 1967, is void as conferring an arbitrary power since it does not provide for a hearing and is also villative of Art. 21 of the Constitution since it does not prescribe ""prcedure "" within  the meaning of that  Article. Justice Krishna Iyer expressed total Article . Justice  Krishna Iyer expressed total agreement with the conclusion reached by Justice Bhagwati in regardf to the construction of expression ""procedure established by  by law"" . In para 115 of the judgement, Mr. Justice Krishna Iyer observed that anything formal, legislatively Justice Krishna Iyer further observed that  law is , when it is legitimated by the conscience and consent of the  community generally and not nay capricious command. It was furhter observed .
22. Shir Paranjpe submitted that the decision in Maneka Gandhi's case  is based upon the inter relationship between Arts. 14, 19 and 21 and the concept of reasonabless in the legislation is projected having regard to the impact of Art. 14 on Art, 21. The submission is that the  concept of 'reasonableness of legilsation' is based ion the availability of Art. 14 in the case of Mrs. Maneka Gandhi, and once it is not held that protection of Art., 14 in the case of Mrs. Maneka Gandhi and once it is held that  protection of Art. 14 is not availabe because of applcaiton of Art. 31C, then it is not necessary that he legislation should be just, fair and reasonable. The submission was advanced by relying upon the observation of Mr. Justice  Bhagwai quoted herinabove, but in our judgement, the decision in Maneka, Gandhi case projecting the concept of reasonableness is not merely due to the impact  of Art. 14 on Article 21. The contention of  Shri Paranjpe loses its merit when refernce is made to the decision of Mr. Justice Chandrachud, as he then was, in  Maneka Gandhi's  case. In para 40 of the Judgement, the learned Judge observed:
23. The decision of the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi's case was approved and reiterated in several subsequent decisions of the supreme Court , and it is not necessary to discuss all those decisions and it wold suffice memrely to kame a reference . The decision are , Madhav Hayawandanrao Hoskot v.  State of Maharastra, , Hussainara Khatoon v. Home Secretary, state of Bihar , Patna,, Bachan Singh v State of Punjab, , Kasturi Lal  Lakshmi Reddy v. State of J. & K., and AIR 1981 SC 746, Francis of coralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi. From this catena of decision of the Supreme Court it must be held that the legislation  providing for deprivation of property must satisfy the requirements of being fair, just and reasonable.
24. Sshri shingavi then submitted that the provision of Chap. V which provide for deprivation of the property and the grant of amount in lieu  thereof, are neither just, nor fair or reaosnable. The submission is that  is the legislation provides for different standards for grant of compensation for compulsory acqisition of lands and such different standards have of lands and  no nexus to the object to be achieved then the legistlation cannot be said to be just, fair and reasonable. The  provision  of  Chap V. held earlier, clearly faovur the owner of land in rural areas and such favourable treatment is not shown to be justified for any  reason whatsoever. There cannot be any difference between the developed town with the municipall care could have no comparison tio the value of the land in rural area, and it is difficult to fathom why more compensation, including solatium is provided in case of lands in rural areas and the same is denied for the lands within the municipal area, which are of very high value. As the legislation providing for compensation is clearly discriminatory and the discriminaiton is not substntiated on valid grounds it must  be held that the provisions of sub-sec. (3) and (4) of s. 44 do not conform to the constitutional right conferred upon the citizen under Art. 300A of the Constitution. In our judgement, even assuming that the provisions of Chap V of the  Act  are protected from challenge under Arts. 14, 19 and 31 due to the applicability of Art. 31C of the Constitution, still the impugned provisions of the Act are required to be sstruck down as the sid provisions are neither just nor fair or reasonable . Our conclusions, therefore, are:
25. In view of our conclusions ,  the petition must succeed and the action taken by the respondent to deprive the petitioner of their  land requires of be quashed.
26. Accordingly, the petition secceeds and the rule is made absolute in terms of prayer (a) . In the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
27. Petition allowed.

Common question of law arise,. A common judgement. 
2. Hereunder a broad outline of the Government REsolutions:   
( C ) By Government Resolution dt. 2nd Mar. 1977 certain supslementary instrucions were issued pertaining tothe accurate estimation of vacancies likely to arise in the a next year, and the continuation of the select list weith the direction that the names from the next years list should be utlisidie only after the earlier is list was exhausted.
(D) Government Resolution dt. 19th Mar. 1979 directed that whn any reversion was to be effected, memberss of the backward Classes already  in service should not be reverted if their strength in the promotion cadre did not exceed the prescribed percentage of reservation. 
(E)  Government Resolution dt. 25th Feb.1980 directed tht if Governmet servants belonging to anyof the 3 of Backward Classes, viz. SC, ST and DT|NT. Are not avialable for the reserved vacancies, then the Government servants belonging to  other catregories of the Backward Classes should be considered for promotion but only up to ther quota. If Government servants belonging  to any of the SC categories of Backward Classes are not available, then the vacancies should be kept vacant for 3 recruitment years and under  no circumstances  should they be filled by promoting non-Backward Classes persons.  
3.  Hereunder Art, 16(1), (2) and (4) of the Constitution:-
4.  The petitioner learned Counsel Mr. Seergai assets that Art. 16(4) is an exception to Art. 16(1) and (2). It confers a discretionary power on Govt, and not no right is conferred  on any person to reservaionof posts. The  power is that Govt should opinion, viz that  a backward class (which includes SCs and STs) is not adequately represented in the services under the State. The discretionary power to make reervations is not an end in itself but merely a means ot an end, viz to secure adequate representation for members of backward clsses. State of Punjab v. HIra Lal, . ARt. 16(4) speaks of adequate representation and unlike Art. 15(4) does not confer a bounty on the Scheduled Classes because of the injustices and ill  treatment of the past. The relevant and ill touchstone of validity is to find out whether the rule of preference secures adquaute representation for the unreprenseted back ward community or goes beyond it"" State of Kerala v. No.M. Thomas, . Once that opinion is formed, the reservation of appointment and posts can be made for achieving ""adequte"" represenation. In the  present case the opinion formed by Govt is tahat SC, ST, DT|NT would be adequated represented in Govt service if they hold 13% , 7% and 4% posts. Any Govt. REsolution doubling these percentages would be contrary to the formataionof te above opinion and would ex facie be void as regards the excess. Once an order is passedby the State under Art. 16(4) that a particular percentage of reservation is necessary to make the representation in the service of the State  adequate,it is not open to the State, either directly orindirectly, by devision a procedure for making reservations,  is necessary to make the representation in the service of the State adequate, it is not opn  tothe Stae, either directly or indirectly, by devising a precedure for making reservations, to incnrease that percentage of backward class to the pupulation has increased. Where reservation is prescribed for distinct categories of backward classes, each class is a unit by itself and reservation for that class cannot be increasedby adding to it unfilled reservation for another distinct class.
5. In emphasising that Art. 16(4) is an exception to Art. 16(1). Mr. Seervai places reliance on the observaions of the Supreme Court in General Manager,  Ss. Rly, v. Rangachari, , Balalji, v. State  of Mysore, , T.Devadasan v. Union of India, , C. A. Rajendran v. Union of India , , State of Punjab v. JIra Lal, .
6.  Mrs Seervai says that for the sake of argumant , even asssuiming Art. 16(4) is not an exceptionto ARt. 16(1) , the violation of the limitaiton imposed by the condition precedent totheexercise of power under  Art. 16(4) would render the implementattion of the roster invalid to the extent that the reservation exceed the limits prescribed by the Resolution. 
7.  On the other hand , Govt, is learned counsel Mr. Singvi urges Art. 16(4) is not an exception to ARt. 16(1) but is a legisaltive device to say emphatically that what is contained in the proviso is not limited by what is stated in the main provision but falls outside it. (state of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas,
8.  It appears that in none of the cases relied on  by learned counsel was this question directly in issue before the Supreme Court. Be that as it may,, be we shall prceed on the footing that  Art. 16(4) is an exception to Art. 16(1) and shall accordingly interpert the impugned Resolustions. 
9.  At the very outset, with his habitual fairnaeess Mr. Seervai  made it clear that though in the petition a ground had been taken that Arts. 16 and 14 of the constitution forbid reservations  at the promotional stage, he does not propose to canvass before us anything of the kind. Mr. Seeravai doen not dispute that (a) SC, ST and DT|NT are Backward Classes; (b) thy require protection; ( C) protection is gien tothem by making reservaton ; (d) the best way to do so is on population basis whch Govt. Resolution dt. 23rd May 1974 has done; (e) the reservation fixed at 13%,7% and 4% (24% ) for SC, ST and DT|NT respectively cannot be said to be excesive. 
10.  Mr. SEervai therefore does not invite us to strike down the impugned Resolustions but says tahat the Resolutions  but says that the Resolutions and Roster must the be so interpreted as to limit the operations to the percentage fixed for each categfory separately to the percentage laid down in the Ressolution. Mr. Seervai grievance is that no less than 2000 officers of the rank of Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors belonging totheGeneral Category are bieng grossly discriminated against by reason of Govt,making unconstitutional, arbitrary and excessive reservations in favour of members belonging to SC, ST and DT|NT. Mr. Seervai saus tahat since the population basis has been adopted, each category of SC, ST DT|NT is a distinct category  and adequacy of reprendetation must be ascertained with respent to each category separately. Accordingly to Mr. Seervai, having formed an opinion that 13& representaton of Scsin the cadr of ACPs will make the representation adequate, Govt. has no power to increase that percentage of 13 (except marginally) much  less double, it because of oppression of SCsin the pse or for any other reason.Mr. SErvai relies son the state ment and figures given in Govet. Affidavit in reply as under:-
Percentage wise this comes to Sc 24.6%, St1.4%DT|NT 7,2% ?Total 33.33%. Mr. Seervai says tah thus to on Govt. own showing the aggregate percentage of 33.33% exceeds the aggregate of 24% fixed by the impugned REsolution; hence is excessive and arbitray. According to learned Counsel, arbitrariness is manifest  from the fact tahtt though indisputably the percentaged of 24 fixed by the Resolution is on theh ratio  oof the overall population of these Backward Classes tothe population of the State  there is no warant to increase theh percentage of 24 of  to 33,.33 unless it is shown that the Backward Classess sin the State has correspondingly increased. 
11.  Mr. Servai advocates that the Resolution and Roster must be so operated that on 13% reservation being reached, the Roster mustbe suspended pro tanto till vacnacies in the reserved   seats  arise. The Roseter is not nanend in itself but a means to an end and once that end is achieved,  the application of the  roster a must be stopped protempore for the concerned category and be revived when the need to make the representation adequate arised in that category. Mr. Seervai says that the roster must be so worked as to keep in view the total strenght of the cadre and the  representation of each total class in the cadrd. As soon as it is fond that the representation of a particular backward clas has reached the desired level of adequae representation, the operation of roster must be suspecded in respect of that class. This will prevent the impermissible advanntage of accepaerated promotion  given to the officvers coming from the backward classesswithout their suffering any disadvantage. The suspension of the roster would only mean that sufh officers would have towait there turn and not jump over officers from the general category. Mr. Servai says that the supreme Court has held that broadly speaking reservaion ought not to exceed 49%; therefore broadly speaking the reservation for backward classess which include SC adnd STs  cannot ordinarily exceed 49%. This proposition only means thatif on the basis of population of oneor more backward class 49% of reservation is required for making representation of those classes adequate, the constitution permits such reservaton. However it is not relevant where the State has formed an opinion as for example in this case, that 24% reservation is necessary tomake the representation of those classes in the service adquate. 
12.  Mr Seervai assails a distinction between ""vacancy"" and 'post. In Concse Oxford Dictionary (1982 Edition ) 'vacancy is defined as udner:-
Mr. Servai therefore sasy that though the Resolutions dt. 23rd May 1974 permits appoinments to posts what in vacancies, also to make appoinments in vacancies, resulting in excessive reservation caonatrary to what the Resolution itself provides  for. 
13.  At this stage the various of clauses of the impugned Resolutions must be analysed .. after providing for reservaion 13% 7% and 4% for SC ,ST and DT|NT respectively, aggregating to 24% clause 2 of the Resolution provides for the Departmental Promotion committee taking a decision on the fitness or unfitness of an officer. The Departments ate required to decide on the compostion of the D.P.C. having regard to the nature of the post|posts for which promotion is sto be made. While referring proposals to the D.P.C. for promotion on the basis of seniority subject to fitness in respect of vacancies expected to arise during a year, the following procedure is laid down, to wit:-   
14.  However, is the Model Roster for promotion. (After reproducing the Model Roster for Promotion and Statement of vacancies in the cadre of A.C.P. filed during the period 23-5-1974 to 30-12-83 and Statement of Vacancies in the cadre of Dy. S.P.|ACP filled after issue of G.R. G.A.D. No. BCC-1072-J dt. 23-5-11974, the judgement proceeds -Ed.)

17.  The latest figures as on 1st Jan 1982 given by Deputy Secretary Ratnaparkhini  in his afidavit-in-reply are as udner
 

Except Scs in Class  IV category the percentages shown in parenthsis are far below  the 13% , 7% and 4% prescribed by the impugned Resolution. These fiigures and percentages caonnot be dismissed as of no relevance as attempted by the petitioners on the ground that they pertain  to all the Govt. service in the state. The fallacy ofsuch of a stand is the that  impugned Resolution lays down reservation norms for a particular service but for all Govt. services in the State, to lay down different norms for different services swould  result in chaos. 
18.  Yet this is exactly what Mr. Seervai says should be done.He says that the police force is something special, intended as it is for the maintenance of law andorder; hence for thehigher officers diferent  norms must be laid down for reservation. Adequacy of representation must be determined with reference toeach cadre separatly, for instance in the prestn case with reference to the cadre of ACPs  in Grater Bombay and not the totality of cadres which constitute Calss I services  under the state of Mharastra. Different cadres canot be treated as though they  are one. For instance, says Mr. Seervai  you cannot clun together different ClassI CAdres in the Forest Department and other services a such as Medical Service, Educational Services, Agricultural Service and the like. Reliance is place on All India Station masters v. General Manager, Central Railways, .Inthat case the road side station masters claimed equality of opportunity for promotion vis-a-vis the guards on the ground that they were entitled to equality of opportunity. I was held  that as road- side station master and guards were recruited separately and formed two separate and distinct classes, there a was no scccope for predicating equality or inequality of opportunity in matters of promotion. Seervai also relies on C.A Rajendran v. Union of India ,  where it was held that equality of opportunity guaranteed by ARt.16(1) means equality as between members of the same class of employees and not equality of between memebers of separate independent calsses.
19.  In these submission there is a basis fallacy, . The relaince on these decisions is misplaced . Even though different sevices may have their own nuance , indisputably all servies are equally important , viewed as they must in the context of society at large  of for whose welfare and benefit each service is intended. To assail a distinction between the specilalaity and importance of   each service and another, resulting in chaos. Hence Governmet hs rightly prescribed reservation norms not for a particular service or services but forall services in the state. It is the over all picture that must the be seen. A.B.S.K. Sangh v. Union of India, . And that is exactly what Govt has done.
20.  Coming to Mr. Seerva's remaining submissions to start with, the detailed procedure laid down in the Resolution makes it clear that it would be a mistake to say that  the Resolustion provides for appointments only to posts and not to vacanies arising from the  posts. Art 16(4) speks of provisions ofr reservation appointment of or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which  in , the opinion of the Statee, is not adequately  represented in the  state services. The Resolution in terms provides  for promotions to Class I, II, III, and IV posts in grades or services. The word ""promotion"" must be given its ued and antural meaning. A post may be newly created or may become available by reason of a vacancy, in which event an apointment must be to  a vacant post and must arise in vacancy. VAcancy must be promotion only when posts fall vacant, that is when vacancies araise. Para 2 ofr the Resolution specifically provides that while filing vacancies expected to arise  during a year, the procedure laid down in Cls. (1) to (6) should be followed. These clauses speak of filling in vacancies   by resorting the to a separate 50 point roster to determine the number of reserved vacancies in a year . the question of promotion would arise only on a post faling vacant and in order to fill in that vacany the roster has been devised. If reservation is to apply to posts in graddes orcadres, then it would not be necessary  to have a roster  because any reserved post falling vacant could straightway  have been filed by the  candidate in the reserved catefory. The very object behind the Resolution and the roster in order to  the achieve the object of adequate represetation to  the backward classes. The Booklet issued by govt entitled ""Reservation and Other Concessions in Govt. Service for backward Classles"", shows that the policy adopted for reservation of posts in various services and cadres is to allot a certain percentage to vacancies accruing in the respective service and cadres.
21.  In Mr. R. balaji v. State of Mysore , while striking down as unconstitutional Govt. order by which 68% of te seats in education institution were reserved for SC, ST and other educationally and socially backward classes on sthe ground of excessive reservation as a fraud on te Constitution,the Supreme Court observed: ""speaking generally and in a broad way, a special provision provision should be less than 50%; how much less than 50% would depend upon the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case"". the percentage of reserved seats must be left  to the discretion of the appropriate Govt. 
22.  The impugned Resolution is ons the same lines as another Resolution de. 13th Sept 1950 where the 3years  carry forward rule was challenged before the Supreme Court in T. Devadassry . Union of India, . The U.P.S.C. had issued a Notification on 6th Feb.1960 for holding a limited competitive examination for promotion   to the regular temporary for promotion to the regualr temporary for  establishment of Asst/ Supst of the Central Secretariat Service. The Notification provided  for a reservation of 171|2%  of the vacancies for members of the SCs and 5% afor  of te STs. The result was announced by the U.P.S.C. sixteen candidates were recommended for appointmentinthe unreserved vacanies and 25 candidate in the reserved  vacancies. Subsequently U.P.S.C. recommended 2 more candidates from the Sc|ST . The number of vacancies expected tob e filled was stated to be 48 of outof which 16 were unreserved and the remaining 32 reserved though in fact the U.P.S.c. recommended the names of only 30 candidatess for the lattercalss of vacancies. Govt. made only 45 appointments out of which 29 which from amaong the candidates beollnging to the Schedule  Castes and Tribes. It was the petitioner grievance that while he had secured 61% marks in the examination, the percentage of marks in the examination, te percetange of marks secured by some of the 29 candidates from the scehedule Castes  and Tribes ws as low as 35%. The petitioners grievance was that the  reservation acatually amde vcame to 65% which was  far in excess of that set out  in the Notification dt. 6th Feb. 1960 of the U.P.S.C. pursuant to  which the competitive examination was held. Had the reservaionbeen limited to 171|2 as stated in the Notification only 8 vacancies would have gone to them  members of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and the rest to the other candidates according to their merit. The Union of India and the U.P.S.C. sought to justify there action by relying on the carry forward rule"" which was permitted for 3 years  by Govt. Resolution dt. 13th Sept 1950 as modified by Supl. Instruction dt. 28th Jan. 1952. Thereby the reservation in the last year camt ot over 50%. The Supreme Court interpreted the REsolution  to mean filing in of vacancies reserved for backward calss by rosort to a roster. Approving the roster system it ws held that the carry forward rules a was an intergral partr of the roster system, though not more than 50% vacancies should fo to the reserved categories. The reservaitons of mote than hlf of the seats for being filled from memebrs of backward calsess is unconstitutional. At  of the Report it was observed that on every occasion when vacancies can be reserved for backward clsses but normaly not more than 50% of the vacancies.In para 18 of the Report ita was observed that te Govt. Resolution did not contemplate reervation of any posts in the service cadere but merely provided for reservation of vacanciesl evn if Govt,. ahd provided for the reservation  of posts for Sc and ST and cent per cent reservation of vacancies oto be filled in a particular year or reservaion of vacancies in excess of 50% would, according to the decision in Balaji case, , not be constitutional. 
23.  In state of Punjab v Hira Lal, AIr 1971 SC 177 , the roster system a was intoduced  to fill up the vacancies. The Supreme Court accepted the reservaiton and roster and in apra 10 observed as under:-
24.  In A.R. Choudhury v. Union  of India, , in compliance with the decision Devadasan's case, the  Ministry of Home Affairs issued a Memorandum modifuing the carry forward rule byproviding that "" inay recruitment year, the number of normalk reserved vacancies and ""the carried forward"" reserved vanccies together shall not exceed 45% of the total  number of vacancies"". Nevertheless, If there be only two vacancies . one of them may be treated as a reserved vacancy. Butif there be only one vacancy, it shall be treated as unreserved . The surplus above 45% shall be carried froward to the subsequent year of recruitment, subject however, to thecondition that the particular  vacancies carried forward do not become time baared due to ther becomig more thatn two years old. The RAilway Board prepared a model reoster sinigifying the turns of reserved and unreseved vacancies. Under the roster 12.5% of the vacancies were reserved for Scheduled Casets and  5%  for Scheduled TRibes. The NOte appended to the roster provided for the carry forward of a resrved vacancy being treated as unreserved in the subseqquent tow recruitment years. The carry forward  rule was upheld. Reiterating the principle laid down in Devadan's case ,  it was observed  at page 536 (AIR); (at Pp. 397, 398 of Lab IC) as under:-
25. The principle ofreservation f vacancies ofr Sc and St out of the  total available vacnacies was recognized in A.B.S.K. Sangh v. Unon of India,, irrespective of whether  Sc or ST ae already duly representned or not in specific cadres of the service  (para 64 of theReport) It a was exphasised that what had to  be seen was the overall picute andnot resticted t a paraticular service or cadre . Ther carry forward rule was uppheld (para 64 of the Repost) It was  emphasised that what had to be seen was the overal picture and not restricted to a particular service of cadere. The carry forward rule was uphle (para 113 of the  Report ) It  was observed at apra 88 of the Report that by the 3 year carry of forward it was dificult to see how in practice, the total cavancies woud be gobbled up the harjan group   virtually obliterating ARt.  16(1). The maximum of 50% to be fair ad reasonable.In para 136 of the Report it was observed as udner:-
26. Thus, once the power to make reservation in  in favour of SCs and STs is exercised in the light of the provisions of ARt. 16(4) the sequitur must be that  a roster pointwise of the purpose of vacancies for which reservation has been m,ade must be brought ino effect, and in ordrto do full justice, a  carry forward rule must be so  applied that in any particualr year the percentage of reservation does not exceed 50% . The open candidates competitng ofr an ureserved vacancy cannot complain if a preference hasbeen given to them in the first instance and in the carry forward period of  3 years, if vancancy is reserved in favour  of Sc or ST candidates. The logical corollary of reservation of   the posts is roster and the leogcal corallary to the roster is ther carry forward rule for a particular number of years. If taking the services under a the State as a whole as   indeed they must be taen, reservationof 13%, 7% abd for SCs STs and DT|NT respectively has to be brought about, it is only done by treating vacancies in posets as reserved vacancies  or unreserved vacancies so that over a number of years a situation can be brought about where ultimately 13% of all cardes where posts are  reserved are maned by Scehdurel Cases personnel, 7% of the posts of the cadre are manned by St persons and 4% of theh posts of the caddre ara manned byDT|NT personal. It is meant to give effect to the logic underlying thereservaion rule: M.K. Janardhan v. Union of India, (1987) 19 Guj LR 879: (1987 Lab IC 394).
27.  In Prem Prakash v, Union  of India,  the Supreme Court  laid down that -
28.  In State of Maharastra v Shivaji Y. GArge, C.a. No. 417|84 (19-10-1984) the supreme Court allowed Govt. to make reservation for backward classes up to 55% of the vacancies every year. Once the power to make reservaiton in favour.Once the pwer Caste and Scheduled Tribes is exercised, it must necessarily follow that a roster pointwise for the purpose of vacancies for which reservaion has been made must be brought into effect and in order to do full justice, a carry forward rule must be so applied thatin any partiacular  year, their is not more than 50% reservation. 
29.  It is not without its own siginificance that Art. 16(4) provides for reservation not only in case of posts but also in case of appointments. When both these expressions haveadvisedly been  used, it would be wholly impermissible to read  ""appointment"" as synonmous with ""post"". The expression ""appointment"" unsoubtedly includes promotion . Even in the case of one post, more than more  appointment may take place in a given period as a result of promotion, retirement, terminations regisnation or death of the incumbent. The  only and reasonable method of applying the reservaiton rule in the case of a single post would be to apply that rule to the vacancies arising in that post, i.e. by reserving a certain number of appointment to be made to that post. H.B singh v P.M.G.A F. 1979 Lab IC 183 (Andh Pra). 
30.  The object of the Resolution and roster clearly is that as and when any vacancy in apromotinal post arised, it should be filled in with reference to the Resolution androster in order to achieve the object of adequate representation tohe backward callsses. The contingency of promotion would arise only on a post falling vacant for whartsoever reason and it is in order to fill in scuh vacancy that the roster has been devised. The question of bounty does not arise. 
31.  It is tus manifest that the roster system, the carry forward rule and reservation of vacancies have been recognised by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has emphasised that the reservaiton made in each year mustbe on the basis of total vacancies. The carary froward principle hs been  recognised and efectuated. The Resolutions and roster wer held valid with the result  that  as and when vacancies arose in each year theywere filled in according to the resolution and roseter. AS the Supreme Court uphled the power to make reservation in each year,m it must necessaruly  follow   that the total number of candidates belonging to backward classes would necessarily exceed the prescribed percentage. In the present case  if the impugned REsolution precribing the reservation of  percentages of for the backward class in te vacanvcies which arise wvery year are to be filled in acordance  with the Resolution and roster, they must necessary exceed the percentage presribed by the Resolultion. Such percnetage is  does not exceed 50%. In fact the percentage is 33.33% ,which is  far below the percentage prescribed by the Sureme court and can be said to be neither arbitray nor excessive. The resoslutionnand the roster andits opeationimpinge none of the attributes judicially enunciated. In the  light thereof Mr. Seerva's copntentions of must fail.. 
32.  Mr. Seerav submissionof discrimination, demoralisation and dissatisfactionis best answered in the words of theh Superem Court in State of punjab v. Hira Lal,  the Report as usder:-
33.  In Lara,machari Sangh case (1980 Lab IC 1235)(SC) it was observation as uner:-
112 The maintenance of efficiency of administrationis bound  to be adversely affected if general candidates ofhigh merit are conrrnespondingly excluded from recruitment because the large bulk of the vacancies, numbering anything over 50% is allotted to  the  reserved quota. In view of a maximum age-limit invaariably prescribed ,. Some of such metitoriuos candidates may be lksot to the service altogether. Viwed in that light, a maximum of 50% for reserved quotes in theiri totality is a rule which appears fair and reasonable  just and equiable and violation of which would cotracence ARt. 335"".
These observations show that the Supreme Court considered that the though there is ""no rigidity about fifty per cent rule which is only a convenient guiedline laid down by Judge"", eficiecny wuld be impaird if ""anything over 50% is allotted tothe reserved quota. No such thing can be said the present case. 
34.  Mr. Seervai projects a dismal futre. He asays if the present roster system is followed, and if the limit of 24% prescribed by the Resolution is sought to be made unlimited, the ressult will be thata by 1992, as many as 69 posts of ACP in Greater Bombay will , at the cost of morale and efficiency, be filled up by theapointness of the back ward Clases, most of whom would be joint to many Inspector by a much as over 15 years .Mr. SEervai relies on several observaions regardiong the importance of efficiency and in particular those in Janki Prasad v. State of J&K  as under:-
35. Mr. SEervai says that  in that in 1992, even according to Govt statistics 32 posts of ACP willbe held by oficers belonging to SC, ST and DT|NT . The percentage would thus be 46.3 which Mr., SEervai  invites us to hold is far in excess of the 24% fixed by the impugned Resolution. 
36.  To all this ther4e isa three fold answer. (A) Reservation is not sought to be made unlimited. (B) None of the observations relied on by Mr. Seervai venture a general proposition that inefficiency must necessarily be associated with memebrs of the backward classes. ( C) We must recall the view of the supreme Court where attempts at prophesy have been frowned upon, and indeed repelled. In Hira Lal case  (Supra) it was observed that reservation of appointments  under Art. 16(4) cannot be struck down no on hypothetical grounds or on imaginary possibilities. In Karmachari  Sangh's case, (1980 Lab IC 1325) (SC) (supra) the petitons attempt to demonstrate that on account of reservation percentages coupled with the carry forward rule it waas perfectly within the relm of possibility that in some years a monoply might be conferred on the SC and ST candidates for certain categories or classes of posts, was repelled with the words- ""The mystic do not scare us. The actual mustbes will alert us. Further inpara 136 it was observed as udner:-
37.  With these observaionin the forefront, it is not possible andin fact would be impermissible,(statstics and charts prepared by both sides notwithstandign), to peep into the future, with hope even of a reasonably accurate predicion of wath will be in 1992. To do so would be conjecture and speculative reasoning. Any assusmption for instance, that all the police inspectors will be promoted would necessarily be without foundatiom, and which among them willbe promoted would necesarily be without foundation, and which among them will be promoted would be guesswork. Promotion is on seniority subject to fitness. It is impossible to predict today who os likely to be promoted by 1992, without ignoring that osmemay die (as in fact one as during the pendency of these petitions), some may leaave, somemay be transferred, some may be sent on deputation. Any attempt at crystal gazing must be esschewed. The exercise is futile, the ressult unpredicatable,. The impugned Resolution laying downtheprinciple of allotting laying vacancies by following a roster cannot be struck down on the basis of future possiblities or on hypothetical grounds. 
38.  Mr. Seervai's endeavour at prediction must fail. 
39.  This sbrings us to the controversy pertaining to the members of the Sceheduled Castes converted to Buddhissm. For convenience we shall refer to them as Buddhist Convertas por Nav-Buddhists. The Resolustion dt 23rd May 1974 makes  reservaiton at 13% for ""Scheduled Castes and SCheduled castes converts to Buddhiosm"". The proportion is 6% and  6.45% respectively, rounded of to 13%. In the petition is as amended it is state that such converts  do not belong tothe Schedule CAstes within the meaningof ""Schedule  Castes"" in the Constitution, hence such  converts canot be treated as memebers  of the Scheduled Castes in the State. The petitions  thereof take  exception to Buddhist Converts being clubbed along with Scheduled Casets in the Resolution . 
40.  Mr. Seervai relied on ARt 366(24) and (25) of the Constituion. Article 366(24) defines ""Schedule Castes "" As ""such castes, races or tribes aas are deemed under ARt. 341 to be Scheduled Castes for thepurpose of this Constitution"". ARticle 366(25) defines, ""Scheduled Tribes"" as such tribes of tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under ARt. 342 to be Scheduled Tribes of for the purpse of this Constitution"".Artilce 341(1) empowers the President to isue in respect to any State or Ukon Territory a notified order sepcigfying races, tribes castes or parts sof groups of them which for the purpose of the Constitution shall be demed to be Scheduled  Castes  in relation to thathstate of Union Territory as the case may be. Article 341(2) empowers Parliament to alter this list by law but it canot be altered by any further Notification.The Prsident has isued theConstituition (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950. Paragraphs 2 speaks of the castes, reaces, or tribes who  shall be deemed to be Scheduled Castes. Para 3 of that Order reads thus-
Mr. Servai says that para 3 indicates that under the Constitution no person can be a member of a  Scheduled Castes if he does  not profess the Hindu or Sikh religion. He says that  a Hindu or Sikh andthereby ceasees to be a Hindu or Sikh and thereby  ceasees to be a member of the Schedule Castes which is a caste peculir to Hinduism and no other religion. Thus Mr. Seera's submission come to this: Only Hindus can be members of the Schedule Castes. Budhist . Thus Mr. Seervai submission come to this: Only Hidus can be members of the Schedule CAstes. Buddhism iss a religion diferent from Hinduism,. Thus Buddhisst Converts cannot be mebers of the Scheduled  Castes. Buddhist Converts must therefore go ut of this category in the Resolution because it is a severable entry andif void can be deleted. The four categoreis.But at the same time Buddhist Coverts, even thoug they may beolong to Backward Classes, have not been included in the list of Bakcward Classes though Christian Converts from Classes  form SC s are. Further for ACPs there is no reservaitons for other Backward Classes. What provision should  be made for Buddissst Converts would be a matter for Government. 
41.  It is correct that members of  the SCs cease to be so when they renounce Hinduism and embrace Buddhism,. This is not disputed by Mr. Singvi and rightly so. 
42.  What however tocuhes this intese human problem is whethr Buddhims Concerts who have emanated from the SCs continue, despite their atempt to escape the shakles of back wardness foisted on them down the ages by their erstwhile co-religions, to be a  backward class despite there converstion to Buddhism. Or whether, in the words of the Supreme Court as will appear later, they ""continue in their oppressive severity in the new environment of a different religious community"". 
43.  The answer is : Yes, they do . They continue to be ""backwared class of citizens for whom Goverment is entitled to make reservation in the maner is has done. There  is on record documentary evidence which supports this. 
44.  In 1961 Government appointed a Committee on the ""Reservation for the Backward Classes in the Services"" to enquiry whether the percnetages fixed for the recruitment of SC|ST, Buddistes and other backward classe to various posts and  undet the Governmet was adequate and whether the said percentage wereproperly implemented. The Committee comprised of the Chaiman B.D. Deshmukh and 6 members . one of who, was Prof. R.D. Bhandare. The Commottee was constituted to inquire into ans report on the following matters. (I) Existing measures taken bythe State to ensure satisfactory recruitment of the backward calsses to the State Public Services . (ii) Wherther and to what extrent  the system of recruitment form the backward classes is calculated to ensure a fair representation f the backward clases and their difficulties of availing themselves ofthe variouss concessions for entry into the services.(iii) Tpo make recommednations for the removal for the those difficulties and in particular to make recommendations into alia whether the reservation for backward classes should be classified on the acategory of the backward callses should communities among, others like Nac-Buddhas be classified. One of the terms for of reference was -
45.  The Committee submitte  its Report in 1964. Para I is divided into 5 headings, viz, and Referecme and REcommendations. These are folowd by Appendices A to E-11 containing statistical data. Para II is divided into 8 heading, viz  The Historical Becessity, An Excamination of Existing Measures And The Extent to which they Have Ensured Satisifactory REcruitment of the backward Classes, Even Indaquate Measures NOt Properly Implemented - Reasons- Attitude, The System of REcruitment and Difficulties Experienced, The Problem of Buddhist: What Category , Other Backward Classes and The SDenotifdied Tribes and The Nomadioc and Semi- Nomadic Tribes TErms of REference Answered and Recommendations. Par I running ino 31 printgd pages is signed by all the members including Prog. Bhandare who has under his signature added ""Subject to the separate note submitted to the honourable Chief Minsiter, Maharastra State"" Part II is Profg . Bhaddare's Note form pages 113 to 235  and comprises of the headilugs out earlier.
46. Answer to not less than 18 question were invited  by the committee from 364 officials and 803 non-officials. Replies were received from 463 officials and 50 non officials. The discrepancy as tothe toal number of oficails arose from the fact that some of the recipients circulated the questionnaire to thiere subordinate officers who returened the answer directly to the Committee. However nothing turns on this. Question 11 asked what are the difficulties encountreed by the public services and invited suggestions for remedial measures for removal of the difficulties. Question 16 asked for suggestions to invite suitably qualified backward clasess canditated not  forthecoming enrn to fill the reserved quota. Question 17(b) invited anse\wer as towhich category should communites like Nov-Buddhists be classified. 
47.  The committee opined that the percentage of reservation for the backward clases should be linked tothe population statistics of the State, and in so doing the grouping should be-
(i)  Scheduled Tribes including those living outside Scheduled Areas; 
(ii)  Schedulred Castes and Nav-Buddhas; 
(iii)  Denotified Tribes and Nodadic Tribes, and 


(iv)  Other Backward  Classes.
 Further,
 

""For purpose of the above classfication, backwardness has been consered form two aspects.In the first place there is the backward that  has arisen out of historic and geographic isolation of groups from the mainstnream of ""civilisation and as a result these groups apear as anachronisms on the social fabric. There are the Schedukled Denotified while the Nomadic Tribes and Denotified Tribes amy also tha be palced in a simnilar category even though their isolation has perhaps arisen from slightly different ut paraliel causes, having isolated themselves or been isolated having from the mainstream beacause of the nomadic characteristics that ae peculiarly theirs. The second   critieirionis that which arises out of the  stigma of ""touch . Here, the question of New Buddhas who stem from the Scheduled Castes  has to be given some consieration. Concersion aare of two tuypes : firstly conversion arising lut of a genuine change of  faith and secondldy others. Whatever be the  nature of the conversion , at least forthe first generation the complexes that govern such individuals and groups prior to conversion are not shed easily and even in ther environments  there complexes continue to be imaintained and recognised  even though the new groups desire to  eliminate such differentiations partifularly  that of untouchability. Further, the drawbacks and  backwardness of  that have arisen out of generation of such forcible isoslation cannot be overcome atr a stroke. Perhaps the passing of a generation of ore two would effect the desired purpose of the conversion. Until them, to deprive tehm of facilites and concessions that would have been thiere on the basis of their social and economic backwardness would not appear to be quite fair"". (The underlining is ours).  
48.  Chapter V part II which was Prof. Bhandare's NOte was devoted tot he problems of Nav-Buddhists.,. The sum totoal was tabulated as under:-
49.  By Government REsolution dt. 6th July 1960 it was decided that with effect from 1st  May 1060 the SC converts to Buddhism should be  treated as eligible for all concessions and facilities availae to SC except statutory concessions under the Constitution and certain special schemes for te removal of certain untocuhability, whch cound notby their nature apply to non-Hindus. That  Resolution also clarifgied that schj personswould be eligile for psots in Governent SEvices reserved  for SCs. By reason of that Resolution, Rule 40 fo the Bombay Pokice Manual. 1959 Vol. I was amended by subssstittuting the ten existing Rule 40(10) by the new Rule 40(10) (a). 
50.  Therafter by Government REsolution dated 9th April, Government fixed percnetages of reservationin vacancies in various services ofbackward classes including SC and SC Converts to Buddhism. 
51.  It is manifest that the Deshmukh Coomitee Report and Prof. Bhandare's Note (which is part of the REpost), bring  to the forefront that despite their renuncaiaiton of Hinduism, the Buddhist Converts or Nav-Buddhists continue to be subjected to the social ostracism and the stigama of untouchability, handed down to tem generation after generation down to ages. Despite the ameliorative influence of literacy and education the prejudcie against them persists. Conversion ahs made no difference. It has cjhanged nothing. They continue tobe the backward class they ere before conversiosn. For their upliftment and ebing brought into the mainstram of life, perotection had to be given tothem which could est be done by clubbing them withtthe Scehduled Castes from which they emante. To do so, there was mateial before the Government in the form of the Committee REport and Prof. Bhandare's NOte which forms part of the REport. Government a was thereofre justified in accepting this material whichit did by its Resolution dt. 9th April 1965. Having come to th4e conclusion that Nav-Buddhist  si a backward class, Government formed the subjective opinion that for reservation in services, Nav Buddhists who are socially and econimically backward should be put on a par with SCs from which Nav-Buddhists emamated. It cannot be said hat such opinion of Government was arbitray, capricuios or without foundation. Quite the contrary. 
52.  Mr. Seervai cannnot dismiss the Committes recommendations and findings and prof. Bhandare' Note as emre ipse dixit nor can he find fault withthe questions issued by the Committee. He says it doen not invite ansere pertining to social conditions nor was it the objects of the Committee to inverstigate into the social economic political condition of Nav-Buddhists and the depth of humilation to hwich they are subjected. 
53.  This is not entirely correct. The Committee's questionnaire and Report must be read as a whole including Prof. Bhandare's Note which forms part of the REport. The questionnaire was circulated for and wide and answer received. Theyare cogitated upon. Threafter, after holding as many as23 meetings the committee gacat its recommendations coupled with Prof. Governemt and rightly, so. They have sttood thetest of time. They cannot be lightly brushed aside. 
54.  Mr. Seervai says that this Report made in 1964 cannot be considered as giving relevant data applicable today. He invites us to ask Government for up-to-date data. 
55.  In this there isa fallacy. To start with, even Mr. Seervai, with is his habitual fairness, does not say that the reservaion at 13% fixed bythe Resoliution dated 23rd May 19794 for SCs andBuddhist Converts is excessive Judicial notice a can be taken theat in the  intervening years, population has not decreased or even remaind static. It has  increased.. For that matter census of 1971 and 1981 as disclosed by Government reveals as under :-
56.  As to the still continuing stigma undder which they suffer, judical notice fcan be taken tha forno fault of ther the Nav-Buddhistys have not bee n able to break the shackles of the prejudices they faced when they were memebers of the despised Scheduled Castess. They continue ot remain in the same socialand economic condition of backwardness, which by the expedient of conversion they sought to escape. They continue to live with the degrading stgma of untocuhability andits concomitant drawbacks, wihchstalk them inall walks of life. They continued to remain a  backward class, still reviled and staiull looked down upon, and still oppressed by ther more fortunate erswhile co-religious, who by far and large even today keep their distance from them and will not seek ther disnteresrted freidnshsip much less socila intercourse. With them intermingling is unthinkable. They were ostracised then.,?They are ostracised today, conversition notwithstanding. Nothing has changed. The stigma pesists. 
57.  Perhaps to allthis, Mr. Seervai mighty say: Ipse dixit. No., Mr. Seervai,it is not. ""SI Monumentum Requiris Circumspice"". 
58.  Mr. Seervai is extemely critical of the affidavit filed by D.G. Ratnaparkhi. He says here is a senior Government oficer of the rank of Deputy Secretary in the Home Department , who in the body of his affidavit and annexure has attempted to pass off Prof. Bhadnare's Notre as the Committee Reposrt and thereby has attempted to deceive the  petitioners and the Court to  thinking that Prof.Bhandare's Note was indeed the Reposrt of the Committee. 
59.  Mr. Seervais critism is in part not entirely unjusrifiied . It  would have been but proper and pre-eminerntly desirable that  the Deputy Secretary should have clearly specified which portionsin his affidavit and which Exhibit pertianed to Prof. Bhandare's NOte and which portions pertained tothe Report. We would however eschew Mr. Seervai charge of passing off and deciet laid at Ratnaparhi's door. Our reaons are theser : Prof. Bhandare a wass member of te Committee. His NOte is attached tothe REport and forms part of the Report. The one neither conflicts with not is inconsistent with the othr. The one complements the other. Both mustbe read togethr.Merely because Prof. Bhandare's Note contained a recommendation for a separate classficaiton for Nav-Buddhists does not make for inconsistency or contradction. Prof Bhandare's NOte is an assenting opinion expressed in greater detail and an assenting voice spoken with greater emphasios. Mr. Singhavi made a statement before us that the distinction drawn by Mr. Seervai did not even strike hi,, (i.e. MR. Singvi) whn he settled Ratnaparkhi's affidavit. We see no no reason to doubt this statement, coming as it does from responsible counsel . In the circumstances we do not agree with the charge of passing off and deceit which the charge of passing of and eciet which Mr. Seervai levels against Ratnaparkhi. 
60.  Mr. Seervai bitterlyl complaints that though the Committee's Report is referred to in  Ratnaparkhis affidavit and Government relies on it, a copy thereof was not furnished to the petitioner advocate despite a writtern request. The inferences whichMr. Seervai invites us to draw is that thereby with intent invites us to drws is that thereby with intent invites us to draw is that therby with intent to mislead, Government deliberately wanted to keep the petitioners and the Court in the dark regarding prof. Bhandare's NOte.
61. Whiler it was absolutely inforgivable on the part oof Government not no to have acceded to this legitimate request made on bahalf of thepetitioner, the inerence need not necessarily be what Mr. Servai invites us to draw. Without in any maner condoning such behaviour of Governent , wer attribute it not so much to maliceor an attempt to mislead as we do to bad manners born out of pettiness not untouched with silent insoslence. This gratuitous borrishness was righltly not attempted tobe justified by Mr. Singvi . On the contrary he immediately made amends by handing over his own copy of Mr. Seervai, who generously expressed his appreciation of hos learned oponents graciousness. 
62.  Mr. Seervai emphasises sof the burden of proof. He says that in view of Government admission that Nav-buddhists are not SCs, and as an importent constutitional issue has een raised by the petitiners that they should not have been so joined with SCs. It was for Governmetn to prove, which Government has not why the Buddhist Converts were clubbed with SCs. Mr. Seervai quotes-
63.  The short answer is that ther is suficient material, namely the Committee's Report with Prof. Bhandare's assenting NOte, to establsh why Government decided to club the Buddhist Converts withthe SCs in the proportion of 6.45% and 6% respectively, rounded off to 13% in the aggregate. 
64.  Mrsa Seervai places reliance on an unreported judgement delivered by the supreme Court on 30th Sept. 1985 inWrit Petn. No. 9596 of 1983 (since reported in AIR 1986 Sc 73) Movement of Protection of Human Rights of Marginalis Communties v, Union of India. In that case Order 1950 ws constitutionally  invalid on the ground that only Hindu or sikh members of the castes enumertaed in the Schedule to that Order are deemed ot be Sc. For the purposes of the Constitution. The petitionrin that case was a Hindu belonging to the Adi Dravida CAste enumrated in the Schedule. He got himself converted was that notwithstanding his conversion he contined to be a memeber of a\ the Adi Dravida CAste and was entitled to the benefits of welllfare assistance intended for SCs, which by reason ofhis conversion were denied to him. It was debated  before the Supreme Court ""wherther a Hindu belonging toa Sehedule Caste retains his caste on conversiton to Christianity"". It appeared to the Supreme  Court unnecessary to  decide whether a Hindu belonging to the  Adi Dravida Caste contines to be a members of that caste  by reaso of his conversion to the Christian   religion. The supreme Court prceeded on the assumption that the petitioner retained his original caste, and posed the question whether on the mateila before the Cortu, it could be said that inconfining the declaration to memebers of the Hindu and skih religious para 3 of the 1950 Presidential Order discriminattes against mebers of thte Christian relgion. The Supreme Court emphasised that hthe caste system ""is a special feature of the Hindu socail structure"". And a ""social phenomenon peculiar to Hindu Society"".The Supreme court traced the history of ""untocuhability "" and oppresive tyranny, The Supreme Court therafter observed that in order discrimnates agaiant Christian memebrs of the eucmerated castes-
65.  That decision has no applicatio t the maters before us . It is distinguishable. Before the Supreme Court what was challenged was discrimination against the Christian convert. Before us ther is no challenge on the ground of  discrimination agaisnt Buddhist Covnerts. In that case the petitioner failed to make good his assailing the clasification in  para 3 of the 1950 Presidentail Order. The police officers before us do not challenge  the vires of any rule. Unlike the petitionr in the Human Rights case  who failed to place before the Court any ""authoritative and detailed study dealing with the present  conditions of Christian Society"", it is establsihed before us by the Commeitteed Report and Prof. Bhandare's assenting Note that the disabilites  and handicaps suufered by the Buddhist Converts before conversion,. ""continue in ther oppressive severty in the new environment of a different religious community"". 
66.  Mr. SEervai reles on C.M. Arumugam v. s. RAjagopal , AIR 1976 SC 999999399, where the responmdent formerly a memer of the Adi Dravida caste, was converted toChristianity and reconvered to  Hinduism befor the 1967 elections contested by him and the appellant forma reserved constituency. The evidence showd that on reconverion the resondent was acceptee into the fold  by the members ofthe Adi Dravida caste and wa thereofre  at the material time, member of that caste, professing the Hindu religion as requied by paras 2 and 3 of the 1950 Order Mr. Seervai relies on Principal, Guntur Medical College v. Mohan Rao, , where it  was held that on conversion to Hinduism a person bnorn of Christian convertas would not become a member of the faste of wihic his parantrs belonged prior to there conversiohn t Christian as matter of course, but only if he is accpeted by the other  members of the caste to decide whther to admit sucha person withi the cate or not. Mr,. Seervai, relies on Stae of Kerala v. N.M. Thoma, , in support of his proposition that SCs are not caste in the ordinary sesnse which they are understood in Hundu law or Hindu religion.
67.  None of those decision touch the controversy before us. However the  obserations in the last mentioned case pertaining to SCs and STs are pertiment:-
68.  The petitoer exceptio to Buddhist Converta being inclued with the Schedule castes must stand repelled. 
69.  The petition are dismissed with no order as to costs. 
70.  Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court under Art. 134A of the Constitution granted to the petitioners.
71. Petitions dismissed.

Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.1. The petitioner has challenged his retirement from service under Rule 5.32A (C) of the Punjab Civil Services Rules Volume II read with Rule 3.26 (d) of the Punjab Civil Services Rules Volume I Part I, as applicable to the employees of the State of Haryana.
2. The facts necessary for deciding the legality and justification of order Annexure P-8 passed by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Haryana are that the petitioner joined service as Deputy Range Officer. He was promoted as Range Officer on 14.6.1972. His claim for promotion to the post of Divisional Forest Officer with effect from 25.4.1990, the date on which his junior Shri Maya Ram was promoted has not been entertained by the respondents. By the impugned order he has been retired from service.
3. The petitioner has challenged his retirement on the following two grounds:-
4. The respondents have justified the impugned order by stating that the competent authority has, after thorough evaluation of his service record came to the conclusion that the petitioner's retention in service is not in public interest.
5. Shri Narender Hooda argued that the impugned order should be declared as vitiated due to malafide because respondent No. 2 was annoyed with the petitioner on account of his making claim for promotion to the post of Divisional Forest Officer and also on account of his having filed C.W.P. No. 13850 of 1997 for quashing the order of transfer dated 4.9.1997. Learned counsel submitted that respondent No. 2 could not digest the fact that the High Court has stayed the petitioner's transfer and, therefore, as soon as he got an opportunity, he misused the power vested in him and secured the petitioner's ouster from service. The second contention urged by Shri Hooda is that the petitioner's record does not contain any adverse material which could constitute basis for forming a bona fide opinion that his retention in service is not in public interest or that he had out lived his utility for public service and, therefore, the impugned decision should be declared arbitrary and be quashed.
6. Shri Amol Rattan controverted the submissions of Shri Hooda by arguing that the petitioner's retirement, which has been passed on the basis of an objective assessment of his service record by a Committee consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Financial Commissioner, the Administrative Secretary and the Head of Department, does not suffer from any illegality. He submitted that charge of malafide levelled against the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest must be regarded as baseless because he has passed the impugned order on the basis of recommendations made by the high powered Committee.
7. We have thoughtfully considered the respective contentions and have carefully gone through the record of the case. There is no dispute between the parties that the Annual Confidential Reports of the petitioner for the last 10 years contain the following entries:-
8. During this period of 10 years, the petitioner has been punished on various counts, the particulars of which are detailed below: -
9. In the light of the above noted favourable and adverse factors available in the petitioner's record, it is to be decided whether the exercise of power by the competent authority under Rule 3.26(d) of the Punjab Civil Service Rules, Volume I, Part I read with Rule 5.32A(C) of the Punjab Civil Service Rules, Volume II, is vitiated due to malafide, arbitrariness or any patent illegality. However, before deciding that, it will be appropriate to analyse the relevant statutory provisions and the some of the judicial precedents on the subject.
10. Rule 3.26(a) and (d) of the Punjab Civil Service Rules Volume 1, as applicable in the State of Haryana, reads as under: -
The Government employee would stand retired immediately on payment of three months pay and allowances in lieu of the notice period and will not be in service thereafter.
(e) A Government employee, other than a Class IV Government employee, may by giving a notice of not less than three months in writing to the appointing authority retire from service-
(i) If he is in Class I or II Service or post and had entered Government Service before attaining the age of thirty-five years after he has attained the age of fifty years; and
 

(ii) (a) If he is in Class HI Service post; or (b) if he is in Class I or Class II Service or post and entered Government Service after attaining the age of fifty five years:
11. The instructions issued by the government vide letter dated 16.8.1983, which is in the centre of controversy are also reproduced below:-
12. The nature, of the power vested in the government and the competent authority to retire an employee before he attains the age of superannuation has become subject matter of decisions by the Supreme Court and all other Courts. Some of the decisions on the subject are:-
(xi Narasingh Patnaik v. State of Orissa, 1996(2) S.L.R. 615;
(xii) Sukhdeo v. The Commissioner, Amravati Division, Amravati and Anr., 1996(4) S.L.R. 8;
(xiii) State of Haryana v. Surja Mal Hooda, 1991(1) R.S.J. 450;
(xiv) K.K. Vaid v. State of Haryana, 1990(1) S.L.R. 1;
(xv) Daya Nand v. State of Haryana and Anr., (1994-1)108 P.L.R. 652 (F.B.);
(xvi) Ram Kishan v. State of Haryana, 1995(3) S.L.R. 452;
(xvii) Chander Bhan Arya v. Secretary to Government, Haryana and Anr., 1997(3) R.S.J. 626; and
 

(xviii) Dharam Singh v. State of Haryana and Anr., 1998(1) R.S.J. 10.
13. The proposition of law laid down in J.N. Sinha's case (supra) reads thus:-
14. In Union of India etc. v. M.E. Reddy and Anr. (supra), the proposition of law has been stated in the following words:-
15. Explaining the object of the rule of premature retirement, their Lordships observed:-
16. Commenting on the scope of the power of judicial review, their Lordships remarked :-
17. In Shri Baikuntha Nath Das v. The Chief District Medical Officer, Baripada (supra), their Lordships of the Supreme Court reviewed various decisions, most of which have been referred to hereinabove and then laid down the following principles: -
18. In K.K. Vaid v. State of Haryana (supra), a Division Bench of this Court struck down the instructions issued by the Government of Haryana vide letter dated 16.8.1983 on the ground that it amounts to an encroachment on the power of the competent authority to decide whether or not an employee should be retained in service. The ratio of that decision can be found in the following observations:-
19. In para 10 of the judgment it was observed as under:-
20. The judgment in K.K. Vaid's case (supra) has been partially reversed by the Full Bench in Daya Nand's case (supra). Para 21 of the decision of the Full Bench which contains discussion on the subject is extracted below:-
21. In Ram Kishan v. State of Haryana (supra) (decided by one of us), the Court outlined the scope of judicial review in such matters in the following words:-
The proposition, which emerge from the above analysis of the Rules, the instructions and the various judicial precedent referred to hereinabove, are:-
22. If we examine the petitioner's case in the light of the above discussion, there is little difficulty in holding that the recommendations made by the Screening Committee for petitioner's retirement from service and the order passed by respondent No. 2 do not suffer from any legal error warranting interference by the Court. It is not a case of no evidence or a case of non-application of mind or consideration of extraneous material. No doubt, the Annual Confidential Reports do not contain many adverse entries but the various acts of financial irregularities committed by the petitioner, for which he has been punished by the competent authority, have been rightly taken into consideration by the Committee for forming an opinion that his further retention in service is not in public interest. The orders of punishment passed by the competent authority, coupled with one ""below average"" entry constituted adequate material on the basis of which any person of ordinary prudence can form a bonafide opinion that the petitioner does not deserve to be continued in service. Therefore, we are unable to agree with Shri Hooda that impugned order is arbitrary or it is vitiated due to non-application of mind.
23. The petitioner's attempt to link the stay of his transfer by the High Court and the impugned action does not merit our approval. The very fact that the impugned order has been passed by respondent No. 2 on the recommendations of Screening Committee is sufficient to negative the plea of malafide exercise of power. That apart, as the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests has not impleaded as party respondent, no finding of malice-in-fact can be recorded against him.
24. There is one more reason for entertaining the petition, namely, the highly contumacious conduct exhibited by the petitioner while invoking extra-ordinary and equitable jurisdiction of the Court. He deliberately avoided reference to the various orders of punishment passed by the competent authority and tried to paint a rosy picture of his service record by stating that he has earned good reports throughout his service career and has earned very good and outstanding remarks in his Annual Confidential Reports of the recent past and but for the fact that the respondents have disclosed the darker side of the petitioner's service record, the Court would have been mislead to believe that the exercise of power vested in respondent No. 2 is vitiated by arbitrariness and malafide. Learned counsel for the petitioner could not explain as to why the petitioner did not make a mention in the writ petition about the orders of punishment. In the absence of any explanation on this count, we are constrained to observe that the petitioner has approached the Court with tainted hands and, therefore, he does not deserve any indulgence.
25. In Civil Writ Petition No 15448 of 1993 Jai Bhagwan Jain v. Haryana State Electricity Board, Panchkula, a Division Bench of this Court took note of the growing tendency among the litigants to pollute the pure fountain of justice and observed as under:-
26. While dismissing the writ petition of Jai Bhagwan Jain, the Court held as under:-
The Division Bench further held:-
27. In Rex v. Kensington Commissioner, 1917(1) K.B.- 486, Cozens Hardy M.R. commented on the conduct of a party in a ex parte application in the following words:-
28. In R. V. Churchwardens of All Wigan, (1876)1 A.C. 611, Lord Haterlay observed :-
29. In Reg. v. Gerland, (1870)39 L.J. QB 86, it was held:-
30. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court have time and again emphasised the necessity of the litigant approaching the Court with clean hands. In Hari Narain v. Badri Das, A.I.R. 1963 Supreme Court 1558, the Apex Court revoked the special leave to appeal granted to the appellant solely on the ground that he made misstated the facts before the Court, some of the observations made in that decision are extracted below:-
31. In Welcome Hotel and Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Ors. etc. A.I.R. 1983 Supreme Court 1215 and in S.P. Chenqalvarara Naidu (dead) by LR.s v. Jagannath (dead) by LRs. and Ors., J.T. 1993(6) S.C. 631, their Lordships held that one who comes to Court must come with clean hands and the Court will refuse to hear a party whose conduct is found to be un-fair. In the latter case, their Lordships further held that where a preliminary decree was obtained by playing fraud on the Court in as-much-as a vital document was withheld in order to gain advantage on the other side, the party doing so deserves to be thrown out at any stage of the litigation.
32. In G. Narayanaswamy Reddy and Anr. v. Government of Karnataka and Anr., A.I.R. 1991 Supreme Court 1726, the Apex Court declined relief to the appellant who had concealed the fact that the award was not made by the Land Acquisition Officer within the time specified in Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act on account of interim stay order passed in a writ petition. While. rejecting the special leave petition, their Lordships of the Supreme court observed :-
33. This Court has also taken a serious view of the contumacious conduct of a party and has declined relief in a large number of cases. In Smt. Bhupinderpal Kaur v. The Financial Commissioner (Revenue), Punjab, (1968)70 P.LR. 169, a learned Single Judge held that if the High Court comes to the conclusion that affidavit in support of the application for grant of writ was not candid and did not fully state the facts but either suppressed the material facts or stated them in such a way as to mislead the Court about the true facts, the Court ought, for its own protection and to prevent an abuse of its process, to refuse to proceed any further with the examination of the merits and where there is such a conduct which is calculated to deceive the Court into granting the order of rule nisi the petition should on that short ground be dismissed.
34. In Chiranji Lal and Ors. v. Financial Commissioner, Haryana and Ors., (1978)80 P.L.R. 582, a Full Bench approved the observations made in Bhupinderpal Kaur's case (supra) and held that where there has been a mala fide and calculated suppressions of material facts which, if disclosed, would have disentitled the petitioners to the extraordinary remedy under the writ jurisdiction or in any case would have materially affected the merits on both the interim and ultimate relief claimed, the writ petition should not be entertained.
35. In Harbhajan Kaur v. State of Punjab and Ors., 1994 P.L.J. 287, a Division Bench held as under: -
36. In Pawan Kumar v. State of Haryana and Anr., 1994(5) S.L.R. 73, another Division Bench held that a party who seeks relief from the High Court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, must come with all bona fides, must make true, candid and full disclosure of all the relevant facts. Its conduct must be above board and there should be no attempt by a party to mislead the Court.
37. By applying the ratio of the decision referred hereinabove and keeping in view the fact that the petitioner intentionally withheld material facts from the Court, we declare that he is not entitled to any relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
38. For the reasons mentioned above, the writ petition is dismissed. The interim order passed on 8.9.1998 is vacated forthwith. It shall be the duty of respondent No. 2 and officers working under him to relieve the petitioner by tomorrow. It is also made clear that the petitioner shall not be entitled to get any benefit of the service rendered by him under the interim order of the Court. However, the pay and allowances paid to him during that period shall not be recovered by the respondents.

 	Heard Shri U.K. Saxena, learned counsel for the petitioner and Shri Gopal Verma, learned counsel for the respondents.
	Petitioner has filed the above noted writ petition praying for quashing of the appellate order dated 12.4.2010 passed by respondent no.3 and punishment order dated 24.8.2009 passed by the respondent no.2 by which major penalty of removing from service, which shall not be disqualification for future employment has been imposed upon  the petitioner by the respondent no.2.
	Petitioner's case is that while serving as officer in scale II of the bank  in Harsh Nagar Branch , Kanpur and thereafter while working  in Lal Bangla Branch,he sanctioned five loans to the  borrowers which  become bad and he was suspended from service by order dated 19.1.2007 in contemplation of disciplinary inquiry. Charge sheet dated 19.5.2006 was issued to the petitioner and he submitted his reply dated 31.5.2007. The departmental inquiry was commenced on 14.7.2008 and concluded on 7.2.2009.The inquiry officer submitted his report dated 20.4.2009 before the disciplinary authority respondent no.2 and inquiry officer  recorded the following findings:-
	The second show cause notice dated 13.7.2009 was issued to the petitioner by the disciplinary authority to submit his reply against the finding recorded by the Inquiry Officer. Petitioner submitted his reply on 29.7.2009 to the same and after consideration of the same the punishment order dated 24.8.2009 was passed by the respondent no.2 awarding major penalty of removal from service which shall not be disqualification for future employment in terms  of Regulation 4(1) of the Bank of India Officers Employees(Discipline & Appeal) Regulations, 1976.
	Petitioner has challenged the punishment order dated 24.8.2009 by means of an appeal before respondent no.3 which was dismissed by appellate authority by his order dated 12.4.2010.
	Supplementary affidavit has been filed by the petitioner bringing on record the Inter Office Memorandum dated 6.6.2009 sent by the Zonal  Manager, Bank of India, to the Chief Vigilance Officer & General Manager as Annexure S.A-1 it has been stated that disciplinary authority recommended punishment of only reduction to a lower stage in time scale but the Chief Vigilance Officer & General Manager recommended imposition of penalty for removal from bank services by the Inter Office Memorandum dated 7.7.2009 attach to annexure S.A.2.	
	Counter affidavit has been on behalf of the respondent stating that the petitioner accommodated certain persons and recommended proposal of housing loan. It is true to state that Sri V.K. Srivastava verified the contents of the application submitted by the borrower and also submitted his brief report but the recommendation prepared in the hand writing of the petitioner clearly reveals something more than that what was submitted by Shri D.K. Srivastava. This aspect clearly confirms that the petitioner had more knowledge about the borrowers than Mr. D.K. Srivastava. In respect of all accounts, processed/recommended by him at Harsh Nagar branch the recommendation of same valuer was obtained despite the fact that no of architects/valuers were on Bank's approved panel. It clearly suggests that favourable valuation report was obtained with a view to justify recommendation/sanction of loan to undeserving borrower. The petitioner was incharge of credit and was fully responsible to ensure the verification of credentials of the owner of the property including the possession thereon and also of cross checking of the presanction report submitted by Mr. D.K. Srivastava which was too precise that such vital information were missing in his report. The facts revealed that on the basis of such incomplete and incorrect information the loan was  sanctioned by Shri V.K. Srivastava, the then Sr. Branch Manager upon the recommendation of the petitioner. It  does not justify the contention to absolve him from the duties performed by him as a recommending authority of Harsh Nagar Branch. There are certain other aspects which has to be looked into while taking a credit decision with regard to new borrower for example annual income, security repayment capacity of the borrower, etc.
 
The document relied by the petitioner (Circular dated 21.7.2005) clearly states that recommending authority shall be responsible for cross checking each and every important aspect of the proposal stated therein and he shall specifically express his views upon acceptability of the proponents and the proposal being within the framework of the policy guidelines of the bank or RBL Govt. of the India etc. and should also adhere to the norms prescribed in this regard. It is further provided that the recommending authority should clearly indicate the deviations, if any, in the prescribed norms/procedures set up in this regard. The pre-sanction inspection report was prepared by Shri D.K. Srivastava but it was not signed by any official of the bank. As a recommending Authority at Harsh Nagar Branch, the petitioner was fully responsible while acting as recommending authority to ensure that proper pre-sanction inspection was carried out before making the recommendation of the loan and moreover he must have satisfied himself with the antecedents of the guarantor/borrower. Instead the petitioner relied upon the pre-sanction inspection report which was prepared by Shri Dinesh Kumar Singh(CTO).
	Mr. Vikram Dixit & Mrs. Sadhana Dixit were existing borrower of Harsh Nagar Branch and Mr. Dixit was borrower/guarantor in different loan account s sanctioned by the branch and therefore it was incumbent upon the petitioner while performing  his duties as an officer of the bank to obtain status report of the borrowers/guarantors from Harsh Nagar branch which was not done by the petitioner and moreover the liabilities of the borrowers or guarantors have neither clubbed nor shown in the borrowers proposal for Autofin loan. If he had done so, the proposal in question could not have fallen under his delegated authority. As regards verification done by Mr. R.C. Jatav, the pre-sanction inspection report of Shri Jatav should have been necessarily cross verified by the petitioner which was not done by him. The petitioner has not made out any good ground for interference by this Court.
	The  respondent-bank has filed supplementary counter affidavit denying that punishment order dated 24.8.2009 was passed by the Chief Vigilance Officer /General Manager. It has been stated that the Chief Vigilance Officer  is a counseling authority to determine and impart advice in the Vigilance matter on looking into gravity of the misconduct proved against the delinquent employee as per guidelines issued by the Central  Vigilance Commission and disciplinary authority  has right to disagree with the same,therefore, petitioner cannot get any benefit regarding this aspect of the case.
	Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that petitioner has accepted the recommendation for sanction of loan and sanctioned the loan there was no fault on his part in case the loan become bad. The inquiry officer has recorded clear finding in this regard that petitioner has not observed guidelines of the Head Office Circular no. 99/66 dated 21.7.2005 in which the role and responsibilities of the recommending officer and sanctioning authority  at branch level   has been clearly defined. This being a finding of fact cannot be interfered with by this court.The appellate authority has also considered the aforesaid contention of the petitioner  and has recorded the finding that appellant is trying to condone his own lapses by citing such non-acceptable propositions.
	The second argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner is that Inter Office Memorandum  brought on record as annexure- S.A.-1 and 2 it was clear that  initially the punishment proposed to him was reduction of ""lower stage in time scale"" which was changed to compulsory retirement and then at the behest Chief Vigilance Officer/General Manager of the Bank the punishment of removal from the service was imposed upon him.
	Counsel for the  respondent has relied upon his counter affidavit and has stated that the petitioner cannot get benefit of the Inter Office memorandum which were exchanged between the disciplinary authority and Chief Vigilance Officer/General Manager since they are in the nature of consultation regarding punishment to be awarded to the petitioner on the basis of findings of the inquiry officer and petitioner has only challenged the  punishment order before the appellate authority and before this court.
 In our considered opinion inter office memorandum do not conform to the definition of punishment order and the   recommendation therein are only tentative and advisory in nature are not conclusive regarding the punishment awarded to the petitioner. Therefore, the arguments of the petitioner has no substance and deserves to be turned down. The petitioner has not been able to establish that procedure of inquiry adopted by the inquiry officer was bad or there is any perversity in the finding recorded by the inquiry officer, like finding being based on inadmissible documents or no material on record, suspicion conjectures and surmises.  The findings of the inquiry officer  are finding of fact and appellate authority has considered each and every finding of the inquiry officer with reference to the material on record by reasoned and speaking order  as required by the Apex Court in the case Divisional Forest Officer, Kothagudem and others vs. Madhusudan Rao (2008) 3 Supreme Court Cases 469, Chairman, Disciplinary Authority, Rani Laksmi Bai Kshetriya Gramin Bank Vs. Jagdish Sharan Varshney & others, (2009) 4 Superem Court Cases 240 and Pradhu Dayal Grover's case (1995) 6 SSC 279.
 It is well settled that High Court can interfere with the orders passed in departmental proceedings to correct the errors of law or fundamental procedural  requirement, which may lead to manifest injustice  and can interfere with the impugned orders in ""exceptional circumstances"" as held in Union of India Vs. Parma Nanda, AIR 1989 SC 1185;State Bank of India Vs. Samarendra Kishore Endow (1994) 2 SCC 537; Transport Commissioner, Madras Vs. A. Radha Krishana Moorthy(1995) 1 SCC 332;State of U.P. Vs. Ashok Kumar Singh, AIR 1996 SC 736; Rae Bareli Kshetriya Gramin Bank Vs. Bhola Nath Singh, AIR 1997 SC1908;Union of India Vs. Ashutosh Kumar Srivastava (2002)1 SCC,188; Lalit Popli Vs. Canara Bank (2003) SCC583.
 In State of Tamil Nadu Vs. S. Subramaniam, AIR 1996 SC 1232, the Apex Court has held that as the High Court has power of judicial review of the administrative action on complaint relating to service conditions of the employee, it is within the exclusive domain of the disciplinary  authority  to consider the evidence on record and to record findings whether  the charge stood proved or not. It is equally settled law that technical rules of evidence have no application in the disciplinary proceedings and the authority is to consider  the material on record. In judicial review, the court has no power to trench on the material on the jurisdiction to appreciate the evidence and to arrive on its own conclusion. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which the decision is made. It is meant to ensure that the delinquent receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the conclusion, which the authority reaches, is necessarily  correct in the view of the Court or the tribunal. When the conclusion reached by the authority  is based on evidence, the court or the tribunal is devoid of power to reappreciate the evidence and  come to its own conclusion on the proved charges. The only consideration the court/tribunal has in its judicial review, is to consider  weather the conclusion is based on the evidence on record that support the finding or whether the conclusion is based on no evidence.
 Learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to point out any such finding which is not based on the evidence on record. Similar view has been taken in the case of General Court Martial Vs. Anil Tej Singh Dhaliwal, AIR 1998, SC 983, Rajinder Kumar Kindra Vs. Delhi Administration, (1984) 4 SCC635 and R.S. Saini Vs. State of Punjab(1999) 8 SCC, 90; High Court of Madras Vs. K. Muthu Kumerswamy (2014) 16 SCC 555; Prem Nath Bali vs. High Court of Delhi (2015) SCC, 415.
 It may be mentioned that it has been repeatedly been held by a series of decisions of the Supreme Court and of this Court that in a Bank the highest standards of integrity and devotion to duty have to be maintained by employees because a Bank runs on public confidence vide Union Bank of India v. Vishwa Mohan, (1998) 4 SCC 310; Sudhir Singh v. District Co-operative Bank, 2003 ALJ 1213; Ram Pratap Sonkar v. Allahabad Bank, 2000 ALJ 2510; K.K. Singh v. Gomti Gramin Bank, 2002 ALJ 480; In fact greater integrity and devotion to duty is required from Bank employees as compared to the employees of other organisations vide V.K. Bahadur V. State Bank of India, 2000 (4) ESC 796. Any leniency shown in such matters would be wholly uncalled for vide Disciplinary Authority v. N.B. Patnaik, 1996 (9) SCC 69.
 In fact in State Bank of India V. T.J. Paul JT 1999(3) SC 385, the Supreme Court held that in the case of Bank employees even if there was no actual loss to the Bank, the employee could be punished for negligence. Hence the argument of the petitioner on that account also fails.
	In view of the above legal position, we do not find any good ground to interfere with the impugned punishment and appellate orders.
	The writ petition is accordingly dismissed but without any order as to costs.

Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month. (1) The Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench 'C' have referred the following question for our opinion :    ""WHETHER on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the claim for deduction of interest levied under Section 139 to the extent of Rs. 11,4701- and in.terest levied under Section 215 to the extent ofRs. 1,04,339- was rightly rejected as not allowable.  
 (2) The assessed is a limited company. The income of the assessed is derived from yarn manufacture and helicopter operations. The Income-tax Officer completed the assessment for the assessment year 1972-73 on 31-6-1972. He levied on the basis of the assessment interest under Section 139 to the extent of Rs. 11,4701- and interest under Section 215 to the extentof Rs. 1,04,339, the total amount of interest being Rs. 1.15,809.The assessed claimed deduction of this interest amount ofRs. 1,15,809'- under Section 37 of the Income-tax Act. 1961in computing the business profits. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax held that the interest was not paid in respect of the capital borrowed for the purposes of the asscssecsbusiness. The assessed went in further appeal to the Tribunal.The Tribunal following the judgment of this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Mahalakshmi Sugar Mills Limited. 85ITR 32(.l) .rejected the appeal filed by the assessed. The a.ssessee, therefore, by an application under Section 256(1) required the Tribunal to state a case and refer the above question for opinion to the High Court.
 (3) Mr. Vaish. learned counsel for the assessed contended before us that interest is compensation paid for the 'user of money and since the money was used by the assessed for the purposes of its business the interest paid under Section 139 and Section 215 should be allowed as deduction under Section 37 of the Income-tax Act. Counsel submitted that the unpaid amount of tax was Rs. 34.37.819/ and the said amount was used by the assessed for the purposes of its business. It was submitted that if the tax amount was paid in time the assessed would have had to borrow the said amount from other sources for the purposes of its business and the interest paid on this borrowed amount would have been deductible under Section 36(l)(iii) of the Income-tax Act. Counsel further contended that the intention of the Legislature was amply made clear by the subsequent insertion of Section 80V which permitted deduction of interest on money borrowed to pay tax. It was further contended that tax,interest and penalty are three different concepts and though under(Section 40(a)(ii) of) the Income-tax Act, tax paid is not deductible; interest paid for delay in payment of income-tax would be deductible under Section 37 of the Act. It was submitted that the judgment of the Delhi High Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v.Mahalaxmi Sugar Mills Limited, (supra) was set aside by the Supreme Court and was no longer good. law.
 (4) Reference was made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Associated Cement Company Limited v. Commercial Tax Officer, Kota, . The SupremeCourt in its majority view observed :    ""THE contention of the assessed in the present case is that as it had deposited the full amount of tax due on the basis of the returns filed under sub-section (1)of Section 7 of the Act at the time when they werefiled, it had complied with sub-section (2) of Section 7 of the Act and that the question of levying interest on the amount of tax which it deposited onthe basis of the revised returns for the period prior to the date of the revised returns did not arise On behalf of the department it is urged before us thatthe words ""on the basis of return"" occurring in subsection (2) of Section 7 of the Act must be read as on the basis of a true and proper return in the context in which those words appear in the statuts and if they are so read, the assessed is liable to pay interest on the deficit amount of tax which was made good on 20/10/1978, for the period between the date on which such deposit or deposits had to be made under Section 7(1) of the Act read with Rule 25 of the Rules and the date on which they were actually made.We are concerned in this case with the liability of theassessed to pay .interest on the amount of tax which remained unpaid. Tax, interest and penalty are three different concepts. Tax become. payable by an assessec by virtue of the charging provision in at axing statute. Penalty ordinarily bc comecs payable when it is found that an asscssce has willfully violated any of the provisions of the taxing statute..Interest is ordinarily claimed from an assessec who has withheld payment of any tax payable by him and it is always calculated at the prescribed rate onthe basis of the actual amount of tax withheld and the exrent of delay in paying it it may not be wrong to say that such interest is compensatory incharacter and not penal.""
 We have carefully gone through the decision of the SupremeCourt in Associated Cement Company Limited v. Commercial Tax Officer, Kota ( supra) case and are humbly of opinion thatthe observations of the Supreme Court made in a different context would not help the assessed. The Supreme Court was concerned in this case with the sustainability of penalty and inter estleviable under the Madhya Pradesh Sales Tax Act and the Central Sales Tax Act for not including the freight charges in the taxable turn over in the original returns and for not paving the tax in respect of such freight charges. On the question of penally the Supreme Court, held on the facts of the case. thatthe levy of penally was unsustainable. However, on the second question of interest the majority view was that the assessec could not escape the liability to pay interest under Section 11B(a) onthe amount of tax withheld as a consequence of his own action or inaction from the last date on which it had to be paid as per sub-section (2) or sub-section (2-A) of Section 7 of the RajasthanSales-tax Act (19 of 1954). The Supreme Court further held that. It is the duty of the court while interpreting the machinery sections so that the charge docs no' fall"".its manifest purpose having a full view of it.Wherever the intention to impose liability is clear  courts ought to have no hesitation in giving what we may call a common sense interpretation to the machinery sections so that the charge does not fall"".In the present case if the assessce is allowed the deduction, as claimed then it would be getting an unfair advantage for not performing its statutory obligation as against the person who paid his tax in time as required under the law.
 (5) Reference, was made to the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Additional Commissioner of Income-tax.A.P. v. Burugupalli China Krishnamurthy and others 121 ITR326(3). This case related to penalty and it was held that since penalty proceedings are penal the onus was on the Department to show that a particular receipt or amount is of revenuenature. This case has no relevance to the question in dispute in the present case.
 (6) In Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal v. BirlaCotton Spinning & Weaving Mills Limited., 82 ITR. 166(4) theSupreme Court observed as follows :    ""THE essential test which has to be applied is whether the expenses were incurred for the preservation and protection of the assessed's business from any such process or proceedings which might have resulted in the reduction of its income and profits and whether the same were actually and honestly incurred.It is not possible to understand how the expenditure on the proceedings in respect of the Investigation Commission by the assessed will not fall within the above rule. Even otherwise, the expenditure was incidental to the business and was necessitated or justified by commercial expediency. It must be remembered that the earning of profits and the payment of taxes are not isolated and independent activities of a business. These activities are continuous and take place from year to year during the whole period for which the-business continues. If theassessed takes any steps for reducing its liability to tax which result in more funds being left for the purpose of carrying on the business there is always a possibility of higher profits.""
 In this case the Supreme Court was concerned with the question whether the expenditure on the proceeding in respect of investigation commission by the assessed was deductible under Section 10(2)(15) of the Income-tax Act. The Supreme Cour thad made the above observation while distinguishing another judgment of the Supreme Court in Travancore Titanium ProductsLimited v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Kerala, 60 Itr 277(5)where it was held that the charge of the tax was the same whether the assets were part of or used in the trading organisation of the owner.
 (7) In the case of Dalmia Dadri Cement Limited v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, 125 Itr 425(6), our High Court while deciding the question whether commission paid on borrowing shares for the purposes of treating them as security to Income tax Department for securing stay of recovery of taxes followed the judgment of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in DalmiaDadri Cement Limited v. Commissioner of Income-tax, 90 ITR297(7) in order to have uniformity of construction in an all India statute like the Income-tax Act. The learned judges however observed that there was no divergence of view with regard to deductibility of interest payments in connection with the liability to pay income-tax.
 (8) The Bombay High Court in Aruna Mills Limited v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Ahmedabad 31 Itr 153(8) had an occasion to consider the question of deductibility of interest which an asscssee had to pay under sub-section (7) of Section ISA for having under-estimated the tax payable by him by way of advance tax and the interest payable to him by the Government under sub-section (5) of the said section in respect of relevant to note at this stage that while referring to the judgment of the Punjab High Court in Oriental Carpet Manufacturers, case the Supreme Court kept open the question regarding the deductibility of interest paid by an assessed on account of delay in payment of the provisional demand of tax under Section 36(l)(iii)and Section 37 of the Income-tax Act. The Supreme Court held that interest payable on arrears of cess under Section 3(3) is inreality part and parcel of the liability to pay cess. The SupremeCourt observed as follows :    ""NOW the interest payable an an arrear of cess under section 3(3) is in reality part and parcel of the liability to pay cess. It is an accretion to the cass.The arrears of cess 'carries' intrest if the cess is not paid within the prescribed period a larger sun will become payable as cess. The enlargement ofthe cess liability is automatic under Section 3(3).No specific order is necessary in order that the obligation to pay interest should accrue. The liability to pay interest is as certain as the liability To paycess. As soon as the prescribed date is crossed without payment of the cess, interest begins to accrue.It is not a penalty, for which provision has been separately made by Section 3(5). Nor is it a penalty within the meaning of Section 4, which provides for a criminal liability and a criminal prosecution.""
 (9) The learned counsel for the assessed fairly conceded that in the case of Commissioner of Income-lax v. Oriental Carpet Manufacturers India Pvt. Ltd.. 90 Itr 373(12) the PunjabHigh Court has held that the interest would derive its colour from the principal amount and will partake of it. The PunjabHigh Court observed as follows    ""IT cannot be said that the interest on payment of delayed tax has many connection with the business ofthe assessed, within the four corners of the aforesaid test. The assessed paid interest in order to get adjustment from the department to pay the incometax by Installments, and this has nothing to do with his business activity. The liability to tax. though arising out of business activity, cannot be said -to being any manner a liability which has anything to do with the business of the assessed. It is merely a consequence of income accruing in such business and nothing more. We do not agree with the observations of the Tribunal that the- treatment ..if interest earned on refund of tax, as income of thetax-payer, has anything to do with interest which anassessce incurs in order to raise money to discharge his income-tax liability. This interest will .derive its colour from the principal amount and will part of it. The interest earned by the department is interest on tax and must be held to be part of thetax. This does not follow when the asscssee :are interest on excess payment of tax. The two situations are totally different.""  
 It was however contended that in view of the judgment of the Supereme Court in Associated Cement Company's case (supra)where Supreme Court has held that interest is compensatory in character the judgment of the Punjab High Court is no longer good law. As Stated above, the Supreme Court had made the observations in Associated Cement Company's case on totally different questions of fact and law and the same weredistinguishable. Moreover the question of deductibility of the amount paid towards interest was specificilly kept open by theSupreme Court in Mahalaxmi Sugar Mills case (supra).
 (10) WE. therefore, have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that interest paid due to delay in payment of lax would also be a part and parcel of the liability to pay income-tax. Since income-tax paid by an assessed is net a permissible deducting the interest paid for delay in payment of income-tax would therefore,also not be a permissible deduction under Section 37 of the Income-tax Act. This interest would take the colour of the original amount liable to he paid as income-tax. The liability to pay arose from failure to pay tax under, section 139 and 215 of the Income-tax Act. Interest was paid as a consequence of default committed by the assessed in discharging its statutoryobligations. Although, it is true that the interest charged, due to failure to comply with the statutory obligation is not a penalty,yet it cannot be said that the payment of such interest is compensation to Government in the ordinary commercial sense.  
 (11) The reference to the insertion of Section 80V will not make any difference for the present case. since the question referred pertains to the assessment year 1972-73 and Section 80V was inserted by the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1975with effect from 1/04/1976.  
 (12) We, threfore, answer the question in the affirmative in favor of the Department and against the assessed leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

Masilamani,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service).

No. 7409 of 1996 challenging the charge memo dated 13.10.1996 served on him. The Tribunal quashed that charge memo. The Government is therefore before this court in this writ petition. Heard the learned counsel on either side.
2. The order in challenge shows that on the same set of facts, the first respondent and another were proceeded with in S.C. NO. 92 of 1992 on the file of Special Judge-cum-Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sivaganga for offences under Sections 7 and 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The impugned order also shows that the said case ended in acquittal by judgment dated 16.9.1994. There is no dispute that the said judgment had become final. The Tribunal perusing the copy of the judgment and the contents of the charge memo found that the facts relied upon in the charge memo are the same facts, on which the first respondent was tried before the Special Court and therefore the acquittal by the criminal court cannot be easily lost sight of in deciding as to whether the departmental proceedings should be allowed to commence. On that premises, the Tribunal held that to allow the departmental proceedings to go on, on the same set of facts on which criminal prosecution was launched, would be an exercise in futility. Learned counsel appearing for the State relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court reported in CORPORATION OF NAGPUR v. RAMACHANDRA G. MODAK  to contend that the acquittal by the Criminal Court by itself would not take away the power of the authority to continue the departmental enquiry; its discretion in that regard remains unfettered and therefore submitted that the impugned order is liable to be set aside. Learned counsel appearing for the first respondent relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court reported in SULEKH CHAND v. COMMISISONER OF POLICE (1994) 28 Administrative Tribunals Cases 711 and contended that once there is an order of acquittal on merits, there is no scope at all to proceed with the departmental enquiry. In that judgment, the Supreme Court of India had stated the principle as hereunder:
Learned counsel for the first respondent also relied upon another judgment of the Supreme Court reported in M. PAUL ANTHONY v. BHARAT GOLD MINES LIMITED (1999 SUPEREME COURT 1416) to reiterate the same principle. In answer to this, the learned Special Government Pleader would argue that the Special Court in this case did not give a honourable acquittal but it is only due to the benefit of doubt arising on the facts available in this case. Therefore such a judgment based on the benefit of doubt alone would amount to acquittal on technical grounds, which will not bar the department to proceed with the enquiry.
3. Having regard to the above submissions, we went though the entire materials on record. In our opinion, the judgment of acquittal giving the benefit of doubt to the accused, cannot be equated to judgment of acquittal on technical grounds. Only when a Court without evaluating the evidence on record, passes a judgment of acquittal on technical grounds - say for want of sanction or sanction accorded not fulfilling the requirement of Law or the prosecution barred by Law of Limitation, it can be said that the said judgment is on technical grounds. There is no dispute before us that on the same set of facts, on which the charge memo is issued, the criminal court was already inclined to give a finding in favour of the employee. The same witnesses, who have been examined before the criminal court and whose evidence the criminal court was not inclined to believe, are going to be examined in the departmental enquiry if it commences. Therefore the judgments of the Supreme Court relied upon by the learned counsel for the first respondent as referred to above would squarely apply to the case on hand. In Sulekh Chand's case, the facts are as hereunder:
The finding in that case is that the departmental proceeding and the prosecution relate to the same transaction and since the judgment of the criminal court acquitting the appellant was on merits and as it had become final, the necessary consequence would be that the delinquent is entitled to reinstatement, as if there is no blot on his service and the need for departmental enquiry is obviated. Only in that context, the Honourable Supreme Court of India held that if an acquittal by the criminal court is on technical grounds, the authorities are entitled to conduct departmental enquiry on the self same allegations and take appropriate disciplinary action. It was emphasised in that judgment, that in that case the acquittal was on merits. In Paul Anthony's case, all the case laws on the issue namely, whether two parallel proceedings can go on were considered at length. The Honourable Supreme Court of India in the above referred to judgment had culled out the principles of law laid down in the earlier judgments and extracted the above as hereunder:
It is no doubt true that in the judgment relied upon by the learned Special Government Pleader namely, , it was held that the power to proceed with the departmental enquiry remains unfettered though the criminal court would have acquitted the accused. As already stated, since in the later judgments of the Supreme Court the principle had been clearly laid down namely, whether to hold back the departmental enquiry or not while criminal prosecution is pending or the criminal court had acquitted the accused, would all depend on the facts of each case; the complex nature of the criminal case and whether the acquittal by the criminal court is on merits or on a technical ground, I am inclined to follow the later judgments. In this case, the criminal court had evaluated the evidence and then acquitted the accused giving the benefit of doubt to him based on the suspicious circumstances brought out in the evidence. Therefore it cannot be said that the acquittal of the accused by the criminal court is on technical grounds only. 
4. Even otherwise, we find that the charge memo should not be allowed to survive any further to culminate in a departmental proceeding, since it would cause considerable prejudice to the first respondent. The sum and substance of the charge is that in the year 1991, the first respondent demanded bribe from a property owner for assessment of her property. The Tamil Nadu State Administrative Tribunal, while admitting the O.A., passed an order on 24.12.1996 permitting the authorities to proceed with the departmental enquiry with a restraint not to pass final orders. The authorities have not chosen to take advantage of this order passed in the year 1996 to even conduct an enquiry. But what they have done is that, on the verge of the first respondent's retirement, they passed an order dated 28.2.2002 suspending him stating that enquiry into grave charges of corruption is contemplated. Therefore the fact remains that in respect of the incident that is shown to have taken place in the year 1991, for fourteen long years, the authorities have not chosen to take action at all except serving the charge memo and the suspension order . The Tribunal found that the charge memo itself had been issued subsequent to the acquittal by the criminal court (ie) almost after two years. Therefore at this distance point of time if the first respondent has to face the departmental enquiry, considerable prejudice would be caused to him.
5. For all the reasons stated above, we are inclined to sustain the order under challenge and accordingly, it is sustained. The writ petition is therefore dismissed. No costs.

involved in all the appeals are common, arising out of identical
set of facts, therefore, same were heard together and are being
disposed of by way of this consolidated order.
2.   First we will take up the cross appeal for the Assessment
Year 2006-07. In the appeal filed by the assessee, following
grounds have been raised:-

justified in relying upon the balance sheet and income and
expenditure account filed before the bank.
X. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the ld. CIT(A)

the A.O. in ignoring the fact that having got the accounts
audited from the special auditor there was no justification to
take into consideration the figure stated in the balance sheet
submitted to the bank, to be the basis of assessment.
XI. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the ld. CIT(A)

                              5
      charitable institution and its income is to be computed on the
     basis of the provisions of sections 11 and 12 of the Act.

     XXII. That the appellant craves leave to add, amend or alter
     any of the grounds of appeal.""
3.     In the appeal filed by the Revenue, it has raised the
following grounds of appeal:-
4.    First we will take up the appeal filed by the assessee, being
 ITA No.3674/Del/2017.
5.    Ground No. 1 & 22 are general in nature and hence need no
 adjudication. On ground No. 2 to 5, no arguments were
 addressed by the Ld. Counsel for the assessee and therefore,
 same are considered dismissed as not pressed.
 6.   The brief facts and background are that the assessee is an
 educational society registered with the Registrar of Firms,
 Societies and Chits, Uttar Pradesh, vide registration dated
 08.09.1994. Looking to the fact that assessee society was
 carrying out educational activities which fell within charitable
 activities u/s 2(15) of the Act, it was granted registration under
 section 12A vide certificate dated 01.10.1999 issued by the
 Commissioner of Income Tax, Meerut. It has been running
 various educational institutions. The assessing officer had
 received information alongwith Balance Sheet & Income and
 Expenditure Account from the Bank, whereby it transpired that
 the society has filed these statement affairs as collateral
 securities before Syndicate Bank, Shastri Nagar, Ghaziabad for
 obtaining loan facilities. On perusal of this Balance Sheet, the
 assessing officer noticed that the society has made huge
 investment in Land & Building and has not filed any return of

                                      7
 income. Accordingly, the assessing officer issued notices under
section 148 asking the assessee to file the return of income for
the purpose of assessing the income which has escaped
assessment. In response thereto the assessee filed the return of
income showing 'nil' taxable income after application of income
as allowed under section 11 of the Income Tax Act. The
computation of income declared by the assessee was as under:-
7.     The assessing officer thereafter issued notices under section
142(1)/143(2). During the course of the hearing, it has been
stated that the assessee had produced books of accounts and the
supporting vouchers. Considering the fact that there were two
sets of balance sheets, the assessing officer recorded the
statement of the Chairman of the society, Mr. K.P. Singh in order
to ascertain the veracity of the Balance Sheet and Income and
Expenditure Account found with the Syndicate Bank. The AO
also recorded the statement of bank manager. As there were two
sets of balance sheet and profit and loss account and there were

                                           8
 variances in the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account filed
with the Syndicate Bank and the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss
Account filed with the return of income, the assessing officer was
of   the   view   that   difference       remained   un-reconciled   and
accordingly considering the complexity of accounts, he referred
the case for special audit under section 142(2A) to M/s R. Mohla
and Co. for carrying out the audit and also made a reference to
the District Valuation Officer for ascertaining the investment
made in the construction of the building. The special auditor,
M/s R Mohla and Co. after examining the books of accounts,
submitted its special audit report to the AO on 31.03.2012 with
their observations and comments. Based on the observations and
comments made by the Special Auditor in its audit report, the
assessing officer issued questionnaire to the assessee to explain
the various contentions and the issues pointed out by the special
auditor in their audit report. After taking into consideration
above facts and the observation made in the special audit report,
the assessing officer computed the income of the society as
Rs.10,47,71,546.      The assessing officer further disallowed the
benefit of the exemption under section 11 on the reasoning that
assessee society has not filed the return as required under
section 139(4A) reads with section 12A(b) of the Income Tax Act
in time. Accordingly, the income was assessed as income from
business/profession in the status of AOP.
8.   Aggrieved by the order of the AO, assesse filed appeal before
the CIT (A).      In the first appeal, the assessee raised various
grounds of appeal challenging the order of the AO. The assessee
objected to the reopening of the assessment and also denial of
                                      9
 exemption under section 11 in respect of the Income applied
towards charitable purposes during the year besides the various
additions and disallowances made while computing income.
Before the CIT (A), the assessee had also filed additional
evidences along with application for admission of such additional
evidences under Rule 46(A). The CIT (A) admitted the additional
evidences and called for a remand report from the assessing
officer.    The assessee in response to notices by the Assessing
Officer had appeared before the assessing officer in the remand
proceedings. Thereafter, a remand report dated 15.07.2013 was
submitted by the assessing officer. In response to the remand
report, the assessee had also filed a rejoinder. The CIT (A) called
for further comments of the AO in the light of the rejoinder filed
by the assessee. The assessing officer submitted his remand
report to the above rejoinder. The CIT (A) vide order dated
22.03.2017 disposed of the appeal by giving partial relief to the
assessee.
9.         Ld. Counsel for the assessee, Mr. Ved Jain first of all
submitted that, so far as Ground No. 6 is concerned, which is
regarding denial of exemption under section 11 of the Act while
computing income of the society, the Assessing Officer while
computing income of the society has denied the benefit of the
exemption under section 11 and 12 of the Act on the reasoning
that no return was filed under section 139(4A) read with section
12A (b) of the Act. The CIT(A) has confirmed the action of the
Assessing Officer holding that provision of section 12A(b)
provides for compulsory audit report which is mandatory
condition for availing exemption under section 11 & 12 of the
                                  10
 Act, and has to be filed alongwith the return of income. The CIT
(A) held that the assessee never filed return as per the stipulated
legal provisions given under section 139(4A) of the Act and it is
only after the issue of notice under section 148, the appellant
society was forced to file the return. The CIT (A) held that non-
filing of return is a sufficient ground to deny the benefit under
section 11 and 12 of the Act. Ld. Counsel submitted that both
AO and CIT (A) have erred in law in not computing the income of
the society as per the provisions of the Act. He submitted that
assessee is a registered as charitable trust under section 12A of
the Act. This fact is not in dispute. Assessee Society is engaged in
imparting education as is evident from its objects as well as the
activities carried out by it which again is not in dispute.
Accordingly, its income is to be computed in accordance with the
provision of section 11 of the Act which provides the method for
computation of income of a charitable society. He submitted that,
as per section 11, income to the extent which is applied towards
charitable purposes is not to be included in the total income of
the previous year including such income which is accumulated or
set apart for application to such purposes to the extent the
income so accumulated or set apart is not in excess of 15% of the
income.
10.       The Ld. Counsel submitted that there is no condition in
section 11 to the effect that income will not be computed under
this section if return is not filed in time. He further submitted
that it does not make any difference whether such income is
being computed in regular assessment or an assessment being
made consequent to reopening of assessment under section 148.
 In this regard he invited our attention to the provisions of section
148, whereby the return filed in response to notice issued under
section 148, is considered as if such return was a return required
to be furnished under section 139 and all the provisions of this
Act are to applied which will include section 11 also. On this
basis, it was contended that the Act does not make any
distinction in the return filed in response to notice under section
148 or a return furnished under section 139. In fact section 148
specifically provides that the provision of this Act shall apply
which will include application of section 11 while computing
income of the society.
11.   The Ld. Counsel further submitted that assessee society
fulfilled all the conditions prescribed in section 12A of the Act as
it has been granted registration u/s 12A BY the Commissioner of
Income Tax.    It has also filed audited accounts alongwith the
return in response to the notice issued under section 148.       In
clause (b) of section 12A there was no condition that such return
should be filed before the due date prescribed in section 139(4A)
of the Act for the Assessment Year under consideration. In fact
such condition has been inserted by the Finance Act, 2017 and
that too from A.Y. 2018-19 by inserting a further clause (ba) after
clause (b). He submitted that wherever the Legislature intended
to deny the benefit in case return is not filed in time, it has made
specific provision in the Act under that section. In support
thereof, the Ld. Counsel invited our attention to the various
amendments made from time to time denying exemption under
different provisions of the Act in case return is not filed in time.
To buttress his argument, he also invited attention to section 10A
 12
 and 10B whereby income of newly established undertaking in
free trade zone and income of newly established 100% EOU are
exempt. In section 10A(1A), a proviso was inserted by the Finance
Act, 2005 with effect from Assessment Year 2006-07, stating that
no deduction under this section shall be allowed to an assessee
who does not furnish a return of his income before the due date
specified under section 139(1) of the Act. Similar proviso was
inserted under section 10B(1)to deny exemption in case the
return is not filed before the due date from A.Y. 2006-07.
Similarly, the Finance Act, 2006 inserted section 80AC of the Act
stating that no deduction under section 80-IA, 80-IAB, 80-IB and
section 80-IC of the Act shall be allowed unless the assessee
furnishes the return of income before the due date prescribed
under section 139(1). The scope of this section 80-AC was further
widened by Finance Act, 2007 to deny exemption under section
80-ID and section 80-IE in case return is not filed before the due
date prescribed under section 139(1).
12.    It was submitted that there was no such condition in
section 11 during the relevant period and it was only the
amendment made by the Finance Act, 2017 with effect from A.Y.
2018-19 that such condition has been clearly spelt for claiming
exemption under this section 11, by inserting clause (ba) in
section 12A. The amendment made by the Finance Act is an
extension of the objects sought to be achieved of getting the
return filed in time.   This clause having been inserted by the
Finance Act, 2017, effective from A.Y- 2018-19 making it pre-
requisite of filing return in time for claiming exemption under
section 11 or 12 of the Act, the same cannot be applied to the
                                13
 assessment years under consideration. In support of the above
contention, Ld. Counsel placed reliance on the judgment of ITAT
Chandigarh in the case of Genius Education Society v. ACIT -
issue has come up.
13.     In counter, the Ld. CIT DR supported the order passed by
the Authorities below and further submitted that the deduction
under section 11 is conditional upon filing of return along with
the audited account before the due date of filing return
prescribed under section 139(4A)of the Act. The assessee having
not filed the return, the benefit of exemption cannot be allowed in
the assessment proceeding under section 148 of the Act which is
only for the benefit of the Revenue as has been held by the
Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax v.
Sun Engineering Works (P.) Ltd. 198 ITR 297 (SC). She further
contended that the intention of the Legislature was always not to
allow the exemption in case return is not filed in time. Thus, the
amendment made by the Finance Act, 2017, inserting a condition
of filing return in time for claiming exemption under section 11
was only a clarificatory amendment and hence, the same will
have retrospective application.
14.     The Ld. CIT DR also filed written submissions in support of
her contention which reads as under:
       section (3) of section 143 or section 144, where the
       assessee objects to the amount of income assessed, or to
       the amount of tax determined, or to the amount of loss
       computed, or to the status under which he is assessed;
   (b) an order of assessment, reassessment or recomputation
       under section 147 or section 150;
   (c) an order under section 154 or section 155 having the effect
       of enhancing the assessment or reducing a refund or an
       order refusing to allow the claim made by the assessee
       under either of the said sections;
   (d) an order made under section 163 treating the assessee as
       the agent of a non-resident:
       section (2) or sub-section (3) or sub-section (5) of section
       185 2°{***]21[in respect of any assessment for the
       assessment year commencing on or before the 1st day of
       April, 1992];
   (h) an order cancelling the registration of a firm under sub-
       section (1) or under sub-section (2) of section 186 22{***]23
       [in respect of any assessment for the assessment year
       commencing on or before the 1st day of April, 1992];
     (i) an order under section 201;
    (j) an order under section 216 in respect of any assessment
        for the assessment year commencing on the 1st day of
        April, 1988 or any earlier assessment year;
    (k) an order under section 237;
    (l) an order imposing a penalty under--
           (i) section 221, or
 (ii)       section 271, section 271A, section 271B,   24[***]25   section
         272A, section 272AA or section 272BB];
 (iii)      26[***]
                  section 272, section 272B or section 273, as they
         stood immediately before the 1st day of April, 1989, in
         respect of any assessment for the assessment year
         commencing on the 1st day of April, 1988 or any earlier
         assessment years.
 For limitation period sec. 153 Expl. 1 clause (iii) clearly
  stipulates that the period of special audit will be excluded from
  the limitation enumerated u/s 153. The only requirement is that
  there should be an order for special audit. Whether for that
  order opportunity was given to the assessee or not, whether
  extension of time for special audit granted by AO is correct or
  not or any grievance relating to the order in respect of section
  142(2A) is not a subject-matter of appeal and cannot be
  challenged before Hon'ble ITAT and can be challenged only in
  writ jurisdiction before Hon'ble High Court which Appellant has
  not preferred to.
 Order u/s 142(2A)/(2c) is not an appealable section and
   Appellant has no right of appeal to challenge the order passed
   by AO u/s 142(2A)/ 142 (2C) before appellate authority u/s
   246 and Hon'ble ITAT has also no authority to adjudicate on
   this. This view is also confirmed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in
   the case of Rajesh Kumar vs DCIT 287 ITR 91 order dated
   01.11.2006 (copy enclosed) where Hon'ble Supreme Court has
   observed in para 52 & 53 of its order that
         ""Whereas the order of assessment can be subject-matter of
         an appeal, a direction issued under section 142(2A) of the Act
         is not. No internal remedy is prescribed. Judicial review

                                    16
   cannot be said to be an appropriate remedy in this behalf.
  The appellate power under the Act does not contain any
  provision like section 105 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The
  power of judicial review is limited. It is discretionary. The
  Court may not interfere with a Statutory power.""
The order of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rajesh
Kumar (Supra) is also followed by Hon'ble ITAT Jodhpur Bench
in the case of ACIT vs Badri Ram Choudhary 355 ITR 223
(Jodhpur) order dated 25.10.2007 (copy enclosed). In this order
Hon'ble ITAT has discussed in a great length the jurisdiction of
Tribunal to examine the validity of section 142(2A) which is as
under :-
3.5. iii On a careful reading of this judgment, it is clearly
deducible that the observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Rajesh Kumar (supra) qua the opportunity of
predecisional hearing for appointment of special auditor has to
be granted to the assessee before issuing direction in a search

                               19
 case has been held to be valid. What is found to be not a correct
position of law are the observations about directions in term of
s. 142(2A) to be given in all cases only after the assessee is
heard. Insofar as discussion in this case regarding non-
appealability of the direction issued under s. 142(2A) before the
Tribunal is concerned, the decision in the case of Rajesh Kumar
(supra) is final and binding as that aspect has not been
disturbed. Even otherwise, a simple and plain reading of the
appealable orders as enumerated in s. 253 leaves nothing to
doubt that the validity of the appointment of special auditor
under s. 142(2A) cannot be questioned before the Tribunal in
the disposal of the appeal on smerits. On contention of the
learned Authorised Representative that the observations of the
Hon'ble apex Court in case of Rajesh Kumar (supra) qua the
examination of validity of the appointment of auditor under s.
142(2A) are ""passing remarks"" and hence should not be read as
substantive law, we are afraid that this submission deserves to
be repelled at the very outset for the reason that even the obiter
dicta of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is binding on the Tribunal.
Almost similar contention was made before the Mumbai Bench
of the Tribunal in the case of Dy. CWT v. Ashwin C. Shah [2002]
76 TTJ (Mumbai) 823 : [2002] 82 ITD 573 (Mumbai). On p. 103
it has been observed as under :
3.5.iv In view of the above discussion, it is amply clear that the
Tribunal being a much inferior authority is bound by the
observations of the Supreme Court, even if these are obiter and
hence cannot look into the validity of order passed under s.
142(2A) as has been held in the case of Rajesh Kumar (supra).
 The scope of examining the issues by the Tribunal has been
spelt in s. 253. The orders under the sections, which are not
brought within the purview of s. 253 cannot be considered and
adjudicated upon by the Tribunal. There are various sections,
the orders under which are not appealable. To cite a few, the
order passed by the CIT under s. 264 is not appealable before
the Tribunal. Similarly, the order passed for transfer of case
under s. 127 is also precluded from examination by the
Tribunal. All such orders are outside the ambit of the Tribunal's
jurisdiction. Our view is fortified by the recent decision in the
case of Smt. Jaswinder Kaur Kooner v. CIT [2007] 211 CTR
(P&H) 200 : [2007] 291 ITR 80 (P&H). In this case the assessee
raised a plea that the order of transfer of It is further observed
""If no such challenge is made at the initial stage, the issue
cannot be raised in appeal against the assessment
order""jurisdiction under s. 127 being void, the entire
assessment proceedings should be annulled on that ground.
The Tribunal came to the conclusion that since the assessee
had not challenged such order at the relevant forum the
assessment could not be set aside. When the matter finally
travelled to the Hon'ble High Court, it was held that the scope of
assessment proceedings under the Act is confined to
determining the income of the assessee liable to tax. If the
assessee is aggrieved by the order of transfer the remedy of the
assessee is to challenge such an order in independent
proceedings either before the higher administrative authorities
as per the Act or in any independent proceedings by way of
writ petition.
3.5.v We are, therefore, not inclined to accept the submission
made by the learned Authorised Representative in this regard
and, therefore, hold that the ""Tribunal is incompetent to
examine the validity of the order for appointment of special
auditor under s. 142(2A) in the course of appeal before it. Once
the Tribunal is held to be debarred from examining the validity
of such order, there is no need to consider the aspects of
complexity of accounts and other matters that weighed with the

                              21
 AO before initiating the process of appointment of special
auditor.....""
On the basis of the above discussion the grounds related to
proceedings u/s 142(2A) of the appeal deserves to be rejected.
B. The following decisions may kindly be considered with
regard to reopening of cases u/s 147 of I.T.Act:
It is to be noted that decision to initiate proceedings is not to be
preceded by any judicial or quasi- judicial enquiry. Reasons
which may weigh with the Assessing Officer may be the result
of his own investigation and may come from any source that
he considers reliable. Formation of his belief is not a judicial
decision but is an administrative decision. Nevertheless, he is
required to act fairly and judiciously.""
In the case of CIT vs Nova Promoters and Finlease Pvt. Ltd. 18
taxmann.com 217 dated 15- 02-2012 the Hon'ble Delhi High
Court has held that as long as there is a 'live link' between the
material which was before the Assessing Officer at the time


                              23
   when reasons for reopening were recorded, proceedings u/s
  147 would be valid. The court also held that -
 In the case of Rajesh Jhaveri Stock Brokers Pvt. Ltd. v ACIT
  (2007) 291 ITR 500 Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that -
  In the case of Raymond Woolen Mills Ltd. 236 ITR 34 Hon'ble
  Supereme Court has held that-
C. In the case of DIT vs. Spic Educational Foundation 257 ITR 46
  order of High Court of Madras has held that ""in the case of
  Section 12A(b) requires the trust which claims the benefit of
  sections 17 and 12, when it files a return of income, to file
  along with that return the report of the audit for that year in
  the Form prescribed under rule 17B of the Income-tax Rules,
  1962. To the extent the return is not accompanied by that
  audit report in Form No. 10B, the assessee will not be eligible
  to claim the benefit of sections 11 and 12"". (Copy enclosed)
D. In the case of Coimbatore Spinning & Weaving Co. Ltd. vs CIT
  95 ITR 375 order of High Court of Madras has held that ""The
  Tribunal was not inclined to accept the assessee's stand that
  the overall stock position should alone be considered.
  According to the Tribunal the assessee was in a fiduciary

                               24
        capacity in respect of the stock declared to the banks, that the
       assessee would not have resorted to exaggerate the stock
       position as there was the possibility of the bank Officials
       checking the stocks and any manipulation discovered by the
       banks would be against its interests and, therefore, the
       assessee should be taken to have given the correct stock
       particulars to the banks in respect of each variety. The
       Tribunal also took the view that it was improbable that the
       assessee confused one variety of cotton for the other and
       declared the stocks to the banks incorrectly because of such a
       mistake and that the stocks declared to the banks should,
       therefore, represent the true stock position and the stock
       position as shown in the books of account could not be relied
       on.
      Regarding submission that the Tribunal should have taken
      judicial notice of the practice followed by the business houses
      of declaring larger stocks to the banks purely for the purpose of
      getting higher loans or overdraft facilities, it was to be held that
      such practice was shown to exist or that it had been recognised
      in the commercial circles or by courts. Even assuming that such
      a practice existed the Tribunal was not expected to take judicial
      notice of such sub-standard morality on the part of the
      assessee so as to enable them to go back on their own sworn
      statements given to the banks as to the stocks held and
      hypothecated by them to the banks, In a case where the
      assessee is confronted with his own sworn statements which
      show a different state of affairs than the one shown in his own
      books of account, heavy burden lies on the assessee to prove
      that the books of account alone give the correct picture, and the
      sworn statements given to the banks were motivated."" (Copy
      enclosed)""
  Mandatory filing of returns
From the above provisions of the Act it is apparent that one of
the important provisions relates to liability to file tax returns
cast on charitable institutions. According to the provision of
section 139(4A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ('the Act'), all
charitable institutions availing exemption under sections 11
and 12 are required to file their return of income for each year
within the time prescribed under section 139. Here it is
pertinent to point out that in cases where the total income of the
institution exceeds Rs. 50,000 in any previous year, its
accounts are required to be audited by a qualified chartered
accountant and the report obtained in the prescribed Form No.
10B. While in the case of institutions whose accounts are not
required to be audited the due date for filing of return is 31st
July of each year, in case of institutions whose accounts are to
be audited, the due date is 31st October of each assessment
year.
Clarification on the issue of insertion of section 12A(ba) of the
Act-
During the course of appellate proceedings on 02.05.2019 it
was argued by the Ld. AR that the registration cannot be
denied on the ground of non-filing of return by the trust as this

                                29
 provision was inserted u/s 12A w.e.f. 01.04.2018 and the case
of the appellant has been completed much before this date. The
plea of Ld. AR is not acceptable as section 12A(1)(b) and section
139(4a) was there in the statute and the appellant has violated
these provisions. The background of amendment made by the
Finance Act 2017 is clarified by the following letter of CBDT
which is self-explanatory-

 Subject: Clarification with regard to the time allowed for filing
 of return of income subsequent to the insertion of Clause (ba)
 in sub-section 1 of section 12A of the income -tax Act, 1961.
 Sir,
 Undersigned is directed to refer to the representation (s)
 received on above mentioned subject stating that while
 processing of ITR-7 for the A.Y. 2018- 19, in respect of the
 belated returns filed u/s 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
 (Act), the following is being communicated u/s 143(1)(a) of the
 Act:-
    Based on this, exemption u/s 11 of the Act has been denied to
    otherwise eligible trust, thereby creating huge demand.
 2. In the matter, the memorandum explaining the relevant
    provisions of the Finance Bill, 2017 reads as under:
3. Additionally, an excerpt of circular 02/2018 dated 15.02.2018
   ""Explanatory Notes to the Provisions of the Finance Act, 2017""
 3. Thus, for a trust registered U/s 12AA of the Act to avail the
   benefit of exemption u/s 11 shall inter- alia file its return of
   income within the time allowed u/s 139 of the Act.
   Accordingly, orders u/s 143(1)(a) in those cases in which
   demand has been raised on this issue may please be
   rectified.
   This issues with the approval of Chairman(CBDT).

 This makes it clear that the said clarification by way of
 amendment was issued to clarify that the trusts who have filed
 belated return u/s 139(4) of the Act cannot be refused grant of
 registration on the ground that the return of income was not
 filed within due date of filing of return whereas the fact of the
 case of the appellant is that the appellant has not filed its
 Return of Income u/s 139(1) or u/s 139(4) i.e. within due date
 or belated. Infact the appellant never filed Return of Income as
 per the stipulated legal provisions given u/s 139(4A) of the Act
 read with section 12A(1)(b) and it is only after the proceedings
 u/s 147/148 of the Act that the Appellant was forced to file the
 return not only for one year but for the assessment years 2006-
 07, 2007-08, 2008-09 & 2009- 10. Further, this is also relevant
 to point out that the provisions of section 147 is for the benefit
 of the Revenue and no benefit can be taken by the appellant for
 claiming exemption u/s 11 & 12 of the Act. Reliance is placed
 on the decision of Sun Engineering of Hon'ble Supreme Court.
 The CIT(A) has also mentioned these facts in the appellate order
 in para 9.3 which is reproduced as under:-
Thus, the assessee society is eligible for computing its income in
accordance with the provision of section 11 of the Act. He was
submitted that, it is a case of assessment under section 143(3)
and the issue of notice under section 148 is only to call for the
return of income and assessee having filed the return along with
the audited balance sheet and profit and loss account, the
assessment order has to be passed under section 143(3). In fact
the order passed by the AO also states that this has been passed
under section 148/143(3) and if that be so, the income has to be
computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act which
includes section 11. In the absence of any specific provision
being applicable for the assessment year under consideration no
new condition can be read into.
17.       The Ld. Counsel further submitted that the reliance
placed by the Ld. DR on the judgment of Sun Engineering Works
Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) is misplaced. In fact, that judgment supports
the case of the assessee. In the case of Sun Engineering, the
assessee intended to re-agitate a claim which was denied in the
original assessment in the re-assessment proceeding under
section 148 of the Act. On these facts it was held that it was not
open to the assessee to seek a review of the concluded item,
unconnected with the escapement of income. In the present case,
firstly there is no original assessment and hence, there is no
question of re-agitating or reviewing of any earlier order. Further,
the issue of deduction under section 11 cannot be said to be
                                  35
 unconnected with the issue of escapement of income on the basis
of which income has been computed by the assessing officer.
Deduction under section 11 is part of the computation of income
which has escaped assessment. Section 11 itself states that the
income to the extent to which it has been applied for charitable
purposes is not to be included in the total income of the previous
year.
18.     As regards the applicability of amendment made by the
Finance Act, 2017, the Ld. Counsel submitted that this
amendment cannot have retrospective operation in view of the
specific mention in the Finance Act, 2017 itself that this
amendment shall be applicable from 1st April, 2018, i.e. A.Y.
2018-19.    He   submitted    that    Legislature   has   specifically
mentioned the date from which this amendment will be effective.
Had the intention would have been to make it retrospective; the
legislature could have stated so. It was further pointed out by
him that though this amendment was made by the Finance Act,
2017 still it was not made applicable for Assessment Year 2017-
18 for which returns were still to be filed when the Finance Bill,
2017 was introduced and was later on notified as Finance Act,
2017 in May, 2017. It was submitted that wherever legislature
intended to give retrospective effect, it has specifically stated so
while making the amendment in the Finance Act. On this issue
he also invited our attention to the various amendments made by
the Legislature by specifically giving a retrospective date such as
section 14A, 80HHC and 148 etc to support its contention that
wherever legislature intended to make retrospective amendment,
it has stated so in the Act itself. The Ld. Counsel in support of his
                                 36
 contention placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court
- Commissioner of Income Tax (Central)- I, New Delhi Versus
Vatika Township Private Limited - 367 ITR 466 (SC) whereby
the apex court has held that a legislation is presumed not to be
intended to have a retrospective operation. The law passed today
cannot apply to the events of the past. He also placed reliance on
the judgment of Karnataka High Court dated 28.06.2016 in the
case    of    PR.     COMMISSIONER     OF    INCOME   TAX   VERSUS   SRI.
DICHUNCHUNAGIRI        SHIKSHANA     TRUST    ADICHUNCHUNGIRI   KSHETRA
NAGAMANGALA TALUK MANDYA - ITA NO. 384 OF 2016.
19.          We have heard the rival submissions and perused the
relevant findings given in the impugned order. The core issues
here is, whether the computation of income of the assessee
society should be in accordance with section 11 or not; and
whether, the filing of audit report alongwith the return filed in
response to notice u/s 148 will entitle the assessee for benefit of
computation of section 11. The AO has denied to compute the
income in accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Act
on the reasoning that assessee has not filed the return under
section 139 (4A) reads with section 12A (b) of the Act. Thus, what
we have to adjudicate is, whether assessing officer was right in
not applying the provisions of section 11 while computing income
of the assessee. It is an admitted fact that the assessee is a
society, who has been granted registration under section 12A of
the Act by CIT looking to its objects of charitable purpose, i.e., it
is    engaged    in    imparting   education    and   running   various
educational institutions. Thus, the registration u/s 12A is fait
accompli and consequently the computation of income has to be

                                      37
 in accordance with sections 11 to 13 of the Act. The assessee
society had not filed its return of income and it was only in
response to notice issued by the Assessing Officer under section
148, the assessee has filed its return of income alongwith the
audited Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Account. Now, whether
the income of the assessee society is to be computed in
accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Act, as it has
not filed the return as required under section 139(4A) of the Act,
but has filed return in response to notice under section 148.
20.      Section 139 falls under Chapter XIV-'Procedure for
assessment' which provides procedures and conditions for filing
of return of income. Section 139(1) mandates every person having
income exceeding the maximum amount not chargeable to tax to
file return of income. Similarly, section 139(1) (4A) mandates that
every person in receipt of income derived from property held
under trust, i.e., charitable trust, etc., to file its return of income
in case its total income exceeds the maximum amount not
chargeable to tax without giving effect to the provisions of section
11 & 12 of the Act. In case of failure to file such return of income
under this section 139, penalty has been prescribed. In case of
failure to file return by any person under section 139(1) penalty
has been prescribed under section 271F. Similarly, in case of
failure to file return by charitable society under section 139 (4A)
penalty has been prescribed under section 272A (2)(e). On a plain
reading of the relevant provisions, in our opinion, failure to file
the return under section 139(4A) cannot be interpreted to mean
that income cannot to be computed in the case of a charitable
trust under section 11 of the Act. During the relevant assessment
                                  38
 years impugned in these appeals, there is no such provision in
the Act that in case return is not filed by charitable society under
section 139(4A), then its income cannot to be computed in
accordance with the provision of the Act.
21.   Further, on going through the provisions of section 148, we
further note that once the return has been filed in response to
the notice issued under section 148, the provisions of this Act
shall apply as if such return were a return required to be
furnished under section 139. Thus, return filed under section
148 is treated as return filed under section 139, which will
include sub section (4A) of section 139. Once, such return is
treated as return filed under section 139, then all the provisions
of Act shall apply which will, include section 11 of the Act. The
phrase ""so far as may be"" in section 148, has to be interpreted in
the manner that wherever conditions of applicability of any
procedure prescribed in any section of the Act is required, then
same has to be applied. If a return has been filed under section
148, then the relevant provisions of section 139 has to be applied
and also the procedure of assessment and computation of
income; and it cannot be interpreted in a restrictive manner to
exclude any procedure. The Hon'ble Apex Court, way back in the
case of R Dalmia & Anr vs. CIT, reported in (1999) 236 ITR 480,
has clarified the interpretation of the phrase ""so far as may be""
However no time limit has been prescribed in this clause (b) of
section 12A for furnishing of such return and the audit report in
the Act. The assessing officer is trying to read a condition in
clause (b) itself to hold that such return has to be filed before the
due date of filing of return in this clause for claiming benefit of
section 11 & 12 of the Act. On going through the clause (b) of
section 12A, we are of the view that the AO is not correct in
reading such condition. All that clause (b) mandates that
provision of section 11 & 12 shall not apply unless the accounts
are audited and a return is filed along with the audited accounts.
Thus, as and when computation is to be done these conditions
need to be complied with. The issue whether return has been
filed in time or not is not relevant for clause (b) of section 12A.
Our above view is supported by the judgment of the Chandigarh
                                 42
 bench of the ITAT in the case of Genius Education Society vs.
ACIT ITA No.238/Chd/2018 dated 20.08.2018 wherein the
Tribunal has held as under:-
9th Feb., 1978, reproduced in the earlier part of the
judgment. As per this circular, it is not mandatory under. s.
12A(b) to file the audit report along with return of income.
Normally, a charitable religious trust or institution is expected
to file auditor's report along with the return but in cases
where for reasons beyond the control of the assessee some
delay has occurred in filing the said report, the ITO, for
reasons to be recorded, has been authorised to condone the
delay in furnishing the auditor's report and accepting the
same at a belated stage. It has been clarified that the
exemption available to the trust under s. 11 may not be
denied merely on account of delay in furnishing the auditor's
report. The word ""shall"" occurring in s. 12A cannot, under the
circumstances, be read as a ""must"" making it mandatory for
the trust to furnish the auditor's report along with the filing of
the return. If for certain unavoidable circumstances, the
assessee is unable to furnish the auditor's report along with
the return then the same can be furnished at a later date
with the permission of the AO who may permit the assessee
to do so after recording its reasons for so doing.""
         13. Counsel appearing for the Revenue then argued that as
        per this circular, the auditor's report could only be furnished
        upto the stage of framing of assessment as the power to
        condone the delay for accepting the auditor's report at a later
        date has only been given to the ITO and not thereafter, i.e., at
        the appellate stage. We find no merit in this submission. The
        CBDT by issuing the Circular dt. 9th Feb., 1978 has treated
        the provision regarding furnishing of auditor's report along
        with the return to be procedural and, therefore, directory in
        nature. By showing sufficient cause, the auditor's report
        could be produced at any later stage either before the ITO or
        before the appellate authority.
        14. In view of the Board's Circular dt. 9th Feb., 1978, the
        requirement of filing auditor's report in Form 10B as provided
        in s. 12A(b) r/w r. 17B of the Rules, the ratio of the law laid
        down by this Court in Jaideep Industries' case (supra) would
        not apply to the present case.""
      11. In view of the above therefore we find no merit in the
      argument of the Revenue that the assessee was not eligible for
      exemption u/s 11 &12 on account of not having complied with
      the requirements of section 12A(1)(b) of the Act.""
24.     The judgment relied upon by the CIT (A) and the Ld. DR in
the case of Director of Income Tax vs. Spic Educational
Foundation 257 ITR 46 (Mad), in our opinion is not applicable. In
this case the issue was of not filing of audit report in Form
No.10B along with the return of income for claiming exemption
under section 11 and 12 of the Income Tax Act. In that case the
Hon'ble Madras High Court after taking note of the provisions of
section 12A (b) and 139(9) has observed that return has to be
accompanied by audit report. In this case the return was filed
but audit report was not filed with the return. This audit report
was also not filed later on. That is why, the High Court observed
that, there is nothing on record to show that assessee had filed


                                    45
 the audit report at any point of time and hence the exemption
cannot be granted in the absence of audit report. Thus, it was a
case of complete failure to file the audit report which is not the
case here. In the present case the assessee society has filed the
return of income and has also filed audited accounts with the
audit report in response to the notice under section 148 on the
basis of which AO has completed the assessment under section
148/143(3). Thus, the audit report was before the AO.
25.   Our above view gets further supported from the amendment
made by the Finance Act, 2017 whereby a further clause (ba)
has been inserted imposing a further condition that such return
of income is to be furnished in terms of section 139(4A), within
the time allowed under that section. Firstly, this requirement was
not there before this amendment; and secondly, this insertion of
additional clause clearly shows that such condition was not there
in existing clause (b) of section 12A. Had such condition being
there in clause (b) itself, then there was no need to insert a
further clause (ba) by the Legislature for denying benefit of
section 11 & 12 in case return is not filed in time as per provision
of section 139 (4A) of the Act. It is relevant to note that clause (b)
has not been amended, but a new clause (ba) which has been
inserted to put a further condition w.e.f 1.04.2018, which was
not there for the assessment years under consideration. It is also
important to note that this condition of furnishing the return
within the time allowed under section 139(4A) has been made
applicable from A.Y. 2018-19 as has been specifically stated in
the Finance Act, 2017 and not for the A.Y. under consideration.
      We are also not in agreement with the contention of the Ld.
                                  46
 DR that this amendment is clarificatory in nature. As rightly
pointed out by the Ld. Counsel that this amendment has been
made by the Finance Act, 2017 effective from A.Y. 2018-19,
meaning thereby that this clause has not been made applicable
even for the A.Y. 2017-18, the return of which were still to be
filed. Thus, the Legislature has thought fit to make this
amendment applicable from next assessment years onwards and
not even to the current A.Y. 2017-18.
26.       Our above interpretation gets supported by the judgment
of the Supreme Court - Commissioner of Income Tax (Central)
- I, New Delhi Versus Vatika Township Private Limited 367
ITR 466 (SC). wherein, their Lordships have observed and held
as under:
   The above judgment has been followed by the Karnataka High
Court in its judgment dated 28.06.2016 in the case of PR.
COMMISSIONER         OF      INCOME       TAX      VERSUS       SRI.
DICHUNCHUNAGIRI SHIKSHANA TRUST ADICHUNCHUNGIRI
KSHETRA NAGAMANGALA TALUK MANDYA BEING ITA NO. 384
OF 2016, While interpreting the amendment made by the
Finance Act No. 2 of 2014 whereby section 11 (6) was inserted so
as to exclude such assets while computing depreciation in
respect of which deduction has been allowed as an application of
income under section 11 of the Act.
 27.    In view of the above, we hold that AO was not justified in
denying the benefit of the exemption under section 11 of the Act
and we direct the AO to compute the income in accordance with
the provision of section 11 of the Act. Ground no.6 is accordingly
allowed.
28.     Ground No. 7 to 10 in assessee appeal are regarding
computation of income by the AO on the basis of the Balance
Sheet and Income & Expenditure account submitted to the
Syndicate Bank for the purpose of obtaining loan facilities. From
the perusal of the assessment order, it is seen that the assessing
officer got information along with the copy of Balance Sheet and
Income & Expenditure Account submitted by the assessee society
as collateral security to Syndicate Bank for obtaining loan
facility. Thereafter, statement of Mr. K.P. Singh, Chairman of the
society was also recorded. The statement of the Bank Manager
was also recorded in order to establish the authenticity of the
Balance Sheet and Income & Expenditure account having been
submitted by the society itself. On the basis of these facts and
information the assessment was reopened. In response thereto
the assessee had filed the return of income along with the
audited Balance Sheet & Income & Expenditure account. Since
the assessing officer found it difficult to reconcile the figures
stated in the Balance Sheet which he has got from the Syndicate
Bank and the Balance Sheet which the assessee has submitted
and its correctness, he referred the matter to the Special Auditor
appointed under section 142(2A) of the Act. The Special Auditor
after carrying out the audit submitted its report with certain
observations about the various expenses debited in the books of
                                50
 accounts. These observations were with reference to the balance
sheet and income and expenditure which were audited by the
special auditor as is evident from the special audit report placed
at paper book page 72 onwards. The AO has accepted the Special
Auditors report and has made various addition and disallowances
based on this report. However, while computing income at the
last page of the assessment order he has taken the income as per
the balance sheet and income and expenditure account which he
had received from Syndicate Bank rather than taking the figure
of income as per the balance sheet and income and expenditure
account which has been subject matter of Special Audit
appointed by the AO himself.
29.   It was submitted by the Ld. Counsel, that the Special Audit
was got done only on the ground as mentioned in the assessment
order on page 3 that there are variation with the balance sheet
and profit and loss account filed with the Syndicate Bank and
filed during the course of the proceedings under section 148 of
the Act which need to be reconciled. The Special Auditor having
carried out the audit and having submitted the report the basis
for computing income has to be on the basis of that report.
30.   It was pointed out by the Ld. Counsel, that Ld. CIT (A) has
duly taken note of the contention of the assessee at page 11 of
his order to the effect that the AO was wrong in assuming the
financials with the Syndicate Bank as correct financials without
verification and corroboration with the material available with
him without there being any evidence to establish the correctness
of the various figures of the income/expenditure, assets and

                                51
 liabilities stated therein. The CIT (A) has also taken note of the
contention of the assessee that the AO on the one hand has
taken surplus from the financials with the Syndicate Bank but
on the other hand has made disallowances/addition on the basis
of the financials as submitted by the appellant. He submitted
that the CIT(A) however, has arbitrarily rejected the contention of
the assessee merely on the ground that it is not the duty of the
AO to prove the financials submitted to the Syndicate Bank are
correct rather it was duty of the assessee to prove as to why the
financial statement filed by the assessee are to be ignored. The
CIT(A) has also ignored the alternative contention of the assessee
that in case the AO was of the view that the financials with the
Syndicate Bank were the correct financials then the income has
to be computed taking into account all the figures stated therein
which will include the application of the income towards the
expenditure stated in the such financial. On this basis it was
argued that the stand of the AO is contradictory.
31.   In reply the Ld. CIT DR placed reliance on the order passed
by the AO and the CIT (A) and in her in her written submissions,
she has relied upon the judgment of the Madras High Court in
the case of Coimbatore Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. vs.
CIT 95 ITR 375.
32.   In rejoinder the Ld. Counsel submitted that in the present
case the AO has carried out the verification to find out the correct
financials and that's why special auditor was appointed. The
special auditor has referred to the balance sheet and income and
expenditure account submitted by the assessee along with return

                                 52
 as giving a true and fair view with subject to the observation as
per Annexure- A attached with the special auditors report. Thus,
the financials submitted by the assessee along with the return
having been verified by the AO himself through the Special
Auditor, that financial itself should be the basis of computation
of income. It was submitted that the judgment in the case of
Coimbatore Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. vs. CIT 95 ITR
375 is not applicable in the present case as in that case the
dispute was the stock as per the books of accounts and the stock
pledged with the bank. The stock was pledged which means that
it was physically available with the bank and hence, what was
stated in the balance sheet was not correct.
33.      We have heard the rival submissions and perused the
order passed by the AO as well as CIT(A). It is a fact that AO
received information alongwith copy of the balance sheet and
income and expenditure account submitted by the society to the
Syndicate Bank as collateral security for obtaining loan facilities.
This balance sheet and income tax expenditure account was
different then the income and expenditure account submitted
with the return of income. In order to find out the authenticity of
such balance sheet with the Syndicate bank, the AO had
recorded the statement of Mr. K.P. Singh, the Chairman of the
Society. In his statement as observed by the AO, Mr. K.P. Singh
could not give satisfactory reply.     The AO also recorded the
statement of the bank manager. On the basis of the statements
so recorded, it transpired that the financial statements submitted
to the Syndicate Bank are by the Society itself. Since, there were
wide differences in the two financials, the AO referred the matter
                                 53
 to the special auditor. In the show cause notice issued to the
assessee dated 18.12.2011, it has been stated by the Assessing
Officer that the special audit is required as there are two set of
profit and loss account and balance sheet and under these
circumstances there is a complexity and at this stage income,
surplus as well as application cannot be worked out correctly and
hence, it is necessary to get the special audit done under section
142(2A) of the Act. The special auditor after examination of the
books of accounts have stated in their report that the balance
sheet and the profit and loss account are in agreement with the
books of accounts subject to the comments given in the
annexure. Further, the Special Auditor has also certified that the
balance sheet and the profit and loss account give a true and fair
view subject to the observation stated in the audit report. The AO
having referred the matter to the special auditor and having
obtained the special auditor report on the financials statement
submitted by the assessee and having been certified as giving a
true and fair view subject to certain observations thereon, the AO
cannot ignore such balance sheet and the profit and loss account
audited by the special auditor. Further, on perusal of the
assessment order we note that AO has not brought any material
to support that the facts and figures stated in the balance sheet
and profit and loss account submitted to the Syndicate Bank are
the actual facts and figures. The AO being an adjudicating officer
is supposed to assess the correct income. He cannot assess the
income arbitrarily. On going through the assessment order we
note that he has made various additions and disallowances on
the basis of the Special Auditor's observations coming out of the

                                54
 balance sheet and profit and loss account submitted by the
assessee. The AO has also relied upon the special auditor's report
as is evident from the assessment order and he has also issued
show        cause   notices    for   making   various    addition   and
disallowances on the basis of observation made in the special
audit report. But without giving any reason or justification in his
order, Assessing Officer has just picked up the figure of the
excess of income over expenditure from the financials with the
Syndicate Bank rather than taking the figure of excess of income
over expenditure as per the income and expenditure account
audited by the special auditor. The judgment relied upon by the
Ld. CIT DR in its order is not applicable to the present set of
facts. In the judgment relied upon by the Ld. DR, the issue was of
pledged stock with the bank which was physically available in
lock and key with the bank and that is why it was held that the
stock statement given to the bank is to be considered and not the
stock as shown by the assessee in its balance sheet. In the
present case, the dispute about the financial submitted to the
bank and submitted by the assessee with the return of income
has been got resolved by the AO by making a reference to the
special auditor who after auditing has given its report proposing
various additions and disallowances on the financials submitted
by    the    assessee.   The    AO   has   also   made   addition   and
disallowances on the basis of such report. It is not the case where
the AO has rejected the report of the special auditor. On the
contrary he has accepted the report of the special auditor.
34.    In view of the above reasoning, we are of the view that the
income and expenditure account submitted by the assessee with
                                     55
 the return of income which has been audited by the special
auditor should be the basis for computing income as per
provision of section 11 and 12 of the Act. We direct the AO
accordingly.
35.    As regards the alternative contention of the Ld. Counsel
that in case balance sheet and income and expenditure account
submitted with the Syndicate Bank as collateral security for
obtaining bank loan is to be considered as the correct financial of
the assessee society, we are of the view then the same has to be
considered in entirety. The AO cannot pick and choose certain
figures from the financials which have been audited and certain
figures from the balance sheet with Syndicate Bank. However,
since, we have held that the balance sheet and income and
expenditure account which has been audited by the special
auditor shall be the basis for computation of income, this
alternative contention become academic in nature. Ground nos.7
to 10 are accordingly allowed.
36.   Ground no.11 is regarding disallowance of Rs.10,716/- on
account of electricity expenses in the absence of supporting
evidences. This disallowance was made by the AO and confirmed
by the CIT (A).Since, both of them have held that assessee society
is not eligible for computation of income under section 11 of the
Act, income has been computed applying provision of section 28
to section 44D of the Act in respect of the profit and gains of
business or profession. As we have held that assessee society is
eligible for computation of its income under section 11 of the Act,
the issue for consideration is whether such expenditure is to be

                                 56
 taken into consideration while considering application of income
towards charitable purposes. In case it is held that assessee
society has not produced the evidence in support of its claim,
such amount has to be excluded while considering application of
income under section 11 of the Act. On going through the facts
we note that the AO made a total disallowance of Rs.26,548/- out
of which the CIT(A) has deleted the addition of Rs.15,832/- after
calling for remand report on the additional evidences submitted
by the assessee in support of its contention. It has been stated by
the CIT (A) that assessee has submitted proof of payment with
respect to amount of Rs.15,832/- and the payment is also
through banking channel. However, assessee has not produced
any cogent evidence in respect of balance amount of Rs.9,653/-
and Rs.1,063/- and hence, the disallowance was confirmed.
Since, the assesse has not produced cogent evidence about these
expenses of Rs.10,716/-, we confirm the action of the CIT(A) in
disallowing the same. However, this amount instead of making
addition as income need to be excluded while considering
application of   income in terms of section 11 of the Act. This
ground of appeal is disposed of accordingly.
37.     Ground no.12 is regarding addition of Rs.19,965/- made
by the AO on account of car insurance expenses. The AO has
made addition of this amount and the Ld. CIT (A) has confirmed
the same as the assessee has not been able to furnish any proper
evidence in support thereof. In the absence of supporting
evidence, the disallowance made by the CIT (A) is upheld.
However, we have held in ground no.11 that while considering
disallowances in the absence of supporting evidence that the
                                57
 income of the society is to be computed in terms of section 11 of
the Act and accordingly such amount need to be excluded while
computing total application of income. Following the same
reasoning we direct the AO that this amount instead of making
addition as income needs to be excluded while considering
application of income in terms of section 11 of the Act. This
ground of appeal is disposed of accordingly.
38.   Ground no.13 is regarding an addition of Rs.56,700/- made
by the AO in respect of work-in-progress. The AO has made the
addition of this amount and the CIT (A) has confirmed the same.
In the absence of any supporting evidence, the disallowance
made by the CIT (A) is upheld. However, as held above in ground
no.11   while   considering   disallowances    in   the   absence   of
supporting evidence that the income of the society is to be
computed in terms of section 11 of the Act and accordingly such
amount need to be excluded while computing total application of
income. Following the same reasoning we direct the AO that this
amount instead of making addition as income needs to be
excluded while considering application of income in terms of
section 11 of the Act. This ground of appeal is disposed of
accordingly.
39.     Ground no.14 is regarding disallowance of an amount of
Rs.17,91,779/-, by invoking the provisions of section 40(a)(ia) of
the Act on the ground that the society has failed to deduct tax at
source. This disallowance was made and confirmed by the CIT (A)
as income was computed under the head business or profession.
As we have held that assessee society is eligible for computation

                                 58
 of its income under section 11 of the Act, the only issue to be
examined is whether such expenditure can be disallowed by
invoking provision of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act on the reasoning
that assessee has failed to deduct tax at source while making
such payments. Chapter-III of the Income Tax Act is regarding
incomes which do not found part of the total income. Section 11
which falls in this Chapter is regarding computation of income
from property held for charitable/religious purposes and its mode
of computation as per the condition prescribed in these sections
itself. As against this section 40(a)(ia), 40A(3) and section 43B
falls in Chapter IV-D which are applicable for computing profits
and gains of business or profession. Thus, the provisions of these
sections are applicable in respect of profit and gains of business
or profession. This Chapter IV-D is not applicable in respect of
charitable trust or institution whose income is to be computed
under Chapter-III. Accordingly, no disallowance or adjustment
can be made while determining the income of the society under
section 11 of the Act. Our view is supported by the judgment of
the various benches of the ITAT in following cases as relied upon
by the Ld. Counsel:
40.    Ground no.15 is regarding disallowance of Rs.4,91,171/-
and confirmed by the CIT(A) on the reasoning that the same is
penalty levied by the bank for mortgaging a property without the
permission of the prescribed authority by invoking Explanation to
section 37 of the Act. On going through the facts stated in the
assessment order it is apparent that this amount has not been
paid for any purpose which is an offense or which is prohibited
by law. As per Explanation -1 to section 37 such expenditure
which is incurred for any purpose which is an offense or which is
prohibited by law cannot be allowed as deduction while
computing income. Even otherwise Explanation 1 to section 37,
under which this amount has been disallowed, falls in Chapter
IV-D for computation of profits and gains of business or
profession. As we have held while adjudicating ground no.14
hereinabove, that the provisions of Chapter IV-D, i.e., section 28
to 44 D are applicable while computing income of business or
profession and these provisions are not applicable in respect of
the charitable institution whose income is to be computed under
section 11 and 12 of the Act falling under Chapter-III.
Accordingly, this amount cannot be added by invoking provision
of section 37 which falls in Chapter-IV-D not a Chapter-III.
Accordingly, we direct the AO to consider this amount as

                                60
 application of income while computingincome of the assessee
society in terms of section 11 of the Act. This ground of appeal is
accordingly allowed.
41.   In Ground no.16, assessee has challenged the addition of an
amount of Rs.1,82,92,536/- made by AO on account of
investment in fixed deposit. On going through the assessment
order, we note that the AO has made this addition on the basis of
observation made by the special auditor in its report. The special
auditor has observed that 'investment of Rs.1,43,41,000/- was
made during the year and maturity value of Rs.1,08,66,853/- was
credited in the FDR account of which Rs.6,13,853/- was
transferred to interest on FDR account. It is not ascertainable as to
whether interest on matured FDRs have been correctly accounted
for or not and further accrued interest on the balance FDRs as on
31.03.2006 amounting to Rs.40,88,000/- has not been credited in
the books of account.' On the basis of these observations of the
Special Auditor, the AO has held that the assessee has not been
able to provide any document to auditor and to the AO in support
of source of fund for investment in FDR. Therefore, he added the
entire amount of investment in FDR of Rs.1,43,41,000/- .The AO
further added Rs.39,51,536/- assuming that assessee has
earned    interest   of   Rs.47,01,853/-   (i.e.   Rs.6,13,853/-   +
Rs.40,88,000/-). Thus, a total addition of Rs.1,82,92,536/- was
made. The contention of the assessee before CIT (A) was that, this
is not a case of an unexplained investment. The special auditor
has not stated clearly whether this is a case of unexplained
investment. The special auditor has stated that out of the FDR of
Rs.1,43,41,000/-, FDR of Rs.1,02,53,000/- has matured during
                                 61
 the year on which interest of Rs.6,13,853/- was accounted for
and interest on balance FDR of Rs.40,88,000/- has not been
accounted for. It was clarified by the assessee that this interest
was not accounted for as the assessee society is crediting interest
only when interest is received from the bank. Thus, it was a case
of a misinterpretation of the observation of the special auditor.
The CIT (A) has confirmed the above addition on the reasoning
that there is no clarity on the source of investment.
42.         After perusing the special auditor's report and the
assessment order, we are of the view that the AO and CIT(A) both
have gone wrong in assuming that assessee has failed to
explained the source of FDRs. The observation of the special
auditors is arising from the FDRs recorded in the books of
accounts itself. It is not the case of the Special Auditor that FDRs
have not been recorded in the books of accounts. The special
audit report mentions that FDR of Rs.1,02,53,000/- got matured
out    of   Rs.1,43,41,000/-   during   the   year.   Thus,   FDR    of
Rs.1,43,41,000/- is appearing in the books of accounts and has
been accounted for. The Special audit report also states that out
of this FDR of Rs.1,43,41,000/-, FDR of Rs.1,02,53,000/- got
matured during the year. The difference of this Rs.1,43,41,000/-
and Rs.1,02,53,000/- is Rs.40,88,000/- and this amount of
Rs.40,88,000/- is appearing in the balance sheet as on
31.03.2006. Thus, there cannot be any assumption that amount
of    Rs.1,43,41,000/-   and   amount    of     Rs.40,88,000/-      are
undisclosed investment. Accordingly, the addition made on this
account is on incorrect appreciation of facts. As regards the
observation of the special auditor in respect of the interest on
                                  62
 matured FDR, it is seen that the assessee has accounted for the
interest of Rs.6,13,853/-. As regards the interest on the closing
balance of FDR of Rs.40,88,000/- the same having not been
received during the year and assessee society following policy of
accounting of interest accrued on FDRs on receipt basis            no
addition on this account otherwise can be made. In view of the
above facts and analysis, we direct the AO to delete the addition
of Rs. 1,82,92,536/. This ground of appeal is thus allowed.
43.      Ground no.17 is regarding addition of Rs.20,938/- on
account of job work. The AO has made addition of this amount
and the CIT (A) has confirmed the same. In the absence of
supporting evidence, we also confirm the disallowance made by
the CIT (A). However, as we have held in ground no.11 while
considering disallowances in the absence of supporting evidence
that the income of the society is to be computed in terms of
section 11 of the Act and accordingly such amount need to be
excluded while computing total application of income. Following
the same reasoning we direct the AO that this amount instead of
making    addition   as   income    needs   to   be   excluded   while
considering application of income in terms of section 11 of the
Act. This ground of appeal is disposed of accordingly.
44. Ground no.18 is regarding disallowance of depreciation of
Rs.1,72,781/-. The AO has made addition of this amount and the
CIT(A) has confirmed the same. In the absence of supporting
evidence, the disallowance made by the CIT (A) is thus upheld.
However, as held above in many grounds while considering
disallowances in the absence of supporting evidence that the


                                   63
 income of the society is to be computed in terms of section 11 of
the Act and accordingly such amount need to be excluded while
computing total application of income. Following the same
reasoning we direct the AO that this amount instead of making
addition as income needs to be excluded while considering
application of income in terms of section 11 of the Act. This
ground of appeal is disposed of accordingly.
45.    Ground nos.19 & 20 are regarding computation of income
in accordance with the provision of section 11 and 12 of the Act
and not in accordance with the provisions of section 28 to 44 D of
the Act. While adjudicating ground no.6, we have already held
that income of the assessee society is to be computed in
accordance with the provision of section 11 and 12 of the Act.
Accordingly, we direct the AO to compute the income in
accordance with the provision of section 11 and 12 of the Act and
not in accordance with provision of section 28 to 44 D of the Act.
46.       Ground no.21 is regarding not considering capital
expenditure incurred during the year as application of income
towards charitable purposes while computing income of the
assessee society. As per section 11 income of a eligible institution
to the extent of which such income is applied to charitable
purposes in India is not be included in the total income. The
application of the income towards charitable purposes include
application towards acquisition of assets i.e. capital expenditure.
As we have already held hereinabove that income of the society is
to be computed in accordance with the provision of section 11
and 12 of the Act, we direct the AO to consider capital

                                 64
 expenditure incurred during the year as application of income
towards charitable purposes while computing income under
section 11 of the Act. Ground no.21 is accordingly allowed.
47.   Now we take up the appeal filed by the Revenue being ITA
No.4392/Del/2017.
48.   In Ground no.1 the Revenue is challenging the action of the
AO in deleting the addition of Rs.3,96,327/- on account of
processing charges. The assessee has paid this processing fee to
Delhi Board and All India Council for technical education.The AO
disallowed the claim on the ground that assessee has not
produced any document to support its claim. The CIT (A) has
deleted the addition on the basis of the additional evidences
submitted by the assessee and the remand report thereon
received from the AO. The CIT (A) held that assessee has
submitted evidences in support of the expenses incurred. Before
us the Ld. DR could not controvert the above facts.
49.     On perusal of the impugned order, we find that the
disallowance has been deleted by the CIT (A) after considering the
additional evidences and the remand report submitted by the AO.
Accordingly, we uphold the order of the CIT (A) and this ground
of the Revenue is dismissed.
50.   Ground no.2 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.15,832/- on account of electricity expenses. This
ground is the same as ground no.11 in assessee's appeal where
the AO has disallowed a sum of Rs.26,548/- on account of
electricity expenses and the CIT(A) has given partial relief of


                                65
 Rs.15,832/- on the basis of additional evidences in the form of
payment proof after calling from the remand report from the AO.
We note that the disallowance has been deleted by the CIT (A), as
the assessee has submitted the necessary evidence in support
thereof. Accordingly, we uphold the order of the CIT (A) and this
ground of the Revenue is dismissed.
51.    Ground no.3 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.58,026/- on account of work in progress. The AO
had made a total addition of Rs.1,14,726/-. During the remand
proceedings the assessee submitted detailed explanation and
after taking into consideration the CIT(A) give a partial relief
deleting addition of Rs.58,026/- out of the total addition of
Rs.1,14,726/-. Since, the disallowance has been deleted after
considering the additional evidences and the remand report, we
uphold the order of the CIT(A) and this ground of the Revenue is
accordingly dismissed.
52.     Ground no.4 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.30,56,192/-made by the AO on the ground of
unsupported      expenditure.   In        the    remand proceedings the
appellant submitted analysis of these expenditures alongwith the
supporting bills and vouchers. We note that the CIT(A) after
examining       the   remand    report          noticed   that    a    sum   of
Rs.5,77,489/- is the double addition, a sum of Rs.3,86,670/- is
the capital expenditure and further, for Rs.20,31,456/- the
assessee has submitted bills and vouchers. Accordingly, the CIT
(A)   deleted    these   amounts          and     confirmed      the   balance
Rs.60,577/-. Since, the disallowance has been deleted by the CIT


                                     66
 (A) after considering the additional evidences and the remand
report submitted by the AO we find no reason to interfere with
the order of the CIT (A) and this ground of the Revenue is
accordingly dismissed.
53.   Ground no.5 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.26,15,272/- out of the total disallowance of
Rs.27,88,053/- made by the AO on account of the depreciation.
The AO has made the disallowance of depreciation on the
reasoning that the building was under construction as on
31.03.2006 and hence no depreciation can be allowed. During
the remand proceeding before the AO, it was explained by the
assessee opening balance has also been wrongly considered by
the AO while computing disallowance of the depreciation. The
CIT(A) after examination the same has upheld the disallowance of
depreciation in respect of the building under construction on
which depreciation claimed was Rs.1,72,781/- and has deleted
the disallowance of the balance amount i.e. Rs.26,15,272/-. The
Ld. DR could not point out any reason to interfere with the above
findings of the CIT (A). This being a factual finding given by the
CIT (A), we see no reason to interfere with the order of the CIT (A)
and accordingly, this ground of the Revenue is dismissed.
54.   Ground no.6 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.1,21,06,000/- in respect of the cash deposited in
the bank. The AO made this addition on the basis of the cash
deposited of sums amounting to Rs.54,00,000/-, Rs.49,46,000/-,
Rs.60,000/- and Rs. 17,00,000/- in the bank account of the
assessee society. The CIT (A) has deleted the first two amounts

                                 67
 i.e. Rs.54,00,000/- and Rs.49,46,000/- as these deposits in the
bank account do not pertain to the year under consideration. As
regards the balance the CIT (A) noted cash deposits reported by
the AO have been duly recorded by the assessee in its books
accounts as tuition fees and hence addition made by the AO is
double addition. The CIT (A) also noted that the Special auditor
appointed by the AO has also not made any adverse observation
about the cash deposited in the bank. The Ld. DR could not
controvert the above finding of the CIT (A). We are of the view that
the CIT (A) has examined the issue. The deposit in the bank
account having been made out of the books of accounts the same
cannot be considered to be unexplained deposits in the bank
account and accordingly we uphold the order of the CIT (A) and
dismiss this ground of appeal.
55.    In the result, appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for
statistical purposes and that of the Revenue is dismissed.
                  Assessment Year 2007-08
      ITA No.3675/Del/2017 and ITA No.4393/Del/2017
56.     First we take up the appeal of the assessee being ITA
No.3675/Del/2017.
57. In this appeal the assessee has raised following grounds of
appeal:
(ii)   On the facts and circumstance of the case, the learned CIT(A)
       has erred, both on facts and in law, in ignoring the fact that
       failure to file return under section 139(4A) can be a cause for
       levy of penalty under section 272(2)(e) and not denying
       exemption under section 11 of the Act.
7.     On the facts and circumstances of the case, the ld. CIT(A) has
       erred, both on facts and law in confirming the action of AO in
       taking Rs.6,39,13,382/- as returned income of the Assessee.
8.     On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
       CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law, in confirming the
       action of the AO in taking the financials with Syndicate Bank,

                                   69
       Shastri Nagar, Ghaziabad as correct financials and
      determining the income on the basis of such figures without
      ascertaining the correctness of such finding.
9.(i) On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
      CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law, in ignoring the
      balance sheet and income and expenditure account prepared
      by the assessee and relying on the balance sheet submitted
      to the bank.
 (ii) In the absence of any supporting evidence, it was not
      justified in relying upon the balance sheet and Income and
      expenditure account filed before the bank.
10.   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
      CIT(A) has erred, both on facts and in law, in ignoring the fact
      that having got the accounts audited from the special auditor
      there was no justification to take into consideration the figure
      stated in the balance sheet submitted to the bank, to be the
      basis of assessment.
11.   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
      CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
      disallowance of an amount of Rs.22,812/- out of various
      expenses.
12.   On the facts and circumstances of the case the learned CIT(A)
      has erred both on facts and in law, in confirming the
      disallowance of an amount of Rs.27,84,767/- invoking the
      provision of section 40A(3).
13.   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
      CIT(A) has erred both on facts & in law in confirming the
      disallowance of an amount of Rs.73,58,134/- invoking the
      provision of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act.
14.(i) On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
       CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
       disallowance of an amount of Rs.5,60,975/- on account of
       penalty.
   (ii) That the disallowance was made ignoring the fact that the
       said amount does not pertain to penalty related to infraction
       of any statutory law.
15.   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
      CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
      addition of Rs.3,40,399/- on account of investment in FDR
      under section 68 of the Act.
16.   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
      CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
      addition of Rs.6,35,842/- on account of depreciation on
      building.
17.   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
      CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
      action of the A.O. in computing the income by applying
      provisions of section 28 to 44 D for computing profits and
      gains from business and profession, ignoring the fact that the
      assessee is a charitable institution and its income is to be
      computed on the basis of the provision of sections 11 and 12
      of the Act.
18.   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
      CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
      action of the A.O. in not computing the income in accordance
      with the provision of section 11 of the Act.
19.   On the facts and circumstance of the case, the learned CIT(A)
      has erred both on facts and in law, in not considering the
      capital expenditure incurred during the year while computing
      income of the assessee.
20.   The appellant craves leave to add, amend or alter any of the
      grounds of appeal.
58.   Ground No. 1 & 20 are general in nature and hence need no
adjudication; and with regard to ground nos. 2 to 5, no
arguments were addressed by the Ld. Counsel for the assessee
and the same are dismissed as not pressed.
 59.         Ground no.6 is regarding denial of exemption under
section 11 of the Act while computing income of the society. At
the time of hearing before us, both the parties fairly agreed that
this ground raised and the facts in this appeal are identical to
the facts and ground no.6 raised in appeal for assessment year
2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017. Therefore, both the parties
fairly   stated   that   the   outcome   of   the   appeal   in   ITA
No.3674/Del/2017 for assessment year 2006-07 would be
squarely applicable to ground no.6 of this appeal. We have
already decided the appeal for assessment year 2006-07 vide ITA
No.3674/Del/2017 and, for the detailed discussion in that
appeal we have held that AO was not justified in denying the
benefit of the exemption under section 11 and 12 of the Act and
we have directed the AO to allow the benefit of section 11 & 12 of
the Act and compute the income accordingly. Following the same
reasoning we hold that AO was not justified in denying the
benefit of exemption under section 11 of the Act and direct the
AO to compute the income in accordance with the provision of
section 11 of the Act. Ground no.6 is accordingly allowed.
60.      Ground No. 7 to 10 in assessee appeal are regarding
computation of income by the AO on the basis of the Balance
Sheet and Income & Expenditure account submitted to the
Syndicate Bank for the purpose of obtaining loan facilities.
61.      At the time of hearing before us, both the parties agreed
that these grounds raised and the facts in          this appeal are
identical to the facts and ground nos. 7 to 10 raised in appeal for
assessment year 2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017. Therefore,

                                  72
 both the parties fairly stated that the outcome of the appeal in
ITA No.3674/Del/2017 for assessment year 2006-07 would be
squarely applicable to these ground nos.7 to 10 of this appeal. As
we have already decided the appeal for assessment year 2006-07
vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017 and, for the detailed discussion in
that appeal we have held that the income and expenditure
account submitted by the assessee with the return of income
which has been audited by the special auditor should be the
basis for computing income as per provision of section 11 of the
Act. Following the same reasoning we hold that the income and
expenditure account submitted by the assessee with the return of
income which has been audited by the special auditor shall be
the basis for computing the income of the society in accordance
with the provisions of section 11 of the Act. We direct the AO
accordingly. Further, as regards the alternative contention of the
Ld. AR that in case balance sheet and income and expenditure
account submitted with the Syndicate Bank as collateral security
for obtaining bank loan is to be considered as the correct
financial of the assessee society, we are of the view    then the
same has to be considered in entirety. The AO cannot pick and
choose certain figures from the financials which have been
audited and certain figures from the balance sheet with
Syndicate Bank. However, since, we have held that the balance
sheet and income and expenditure account which has been
audited by the special auditor shall be the basis for computation
of income, this alternative contention become academic in
nature. Ground nos.7 to 10 are accordingly allowed.
 62.   Ground   no.11   is   in   assessee's   appeal   is   regarding
confirmation of disallowance of an amount of Rs.22,812/-. This
ground is identical to the ground no.11 in assessee's appeal for
the A.Y. 2006-07 whereby we have upheld the disallowance of
expenditure in respect of which assessee has not been able to
submit evidences. In the absence of supporting evidence, the
disallowance made by the CIT (A) is upheld. However, we have
held that while considering disallowances in the absence of
supporting evidence, the income of the society is to be computed
in terms of section 11 of the Act and accordingly such amount
need to be excluded while computing total application of income.
Following the same reasoning we direct the AO that this amount
instead of making addition as income needs to be excluded while
considering application of income in terms of section 11 of the
Act. This ground of appeal is disposed of accordingly.
63.      Ground no.12 and 13 are regarding disallowances by
invoking the provision of section 40A(3) and section 40(a)(ia).
These grounds are identical to the ground no.14 in assessee's
appeal for the A.Y. 2006-07. In the said appeal we have held that
income of the charitable institution is to be computed under
section 11 of the Act and hence provision of section 28 to 44 D
are not applicable. Following the same reasoning we hold that no
disallowance can be made while computing income under section
11 of a charitable institution by invoking provision of section
40A(3) and section 40(a)(ia). Accordingly, ground nos. 12 and 13
are allowed.
 64.   Ground no.14 is regarding disallowance of an amount of
Rs.5,60,975/- on account of penalty. This ground is identical to
the ground no.15 in assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07. In the
said appeal we have deleted this disallowance holding that
Explanation 1 to section 37 is not applicable while computing
income of charitable institution under section 11 of the Act and
further amount paid to bank will not fall within the meaning of
expenditure for any purpose which is an offence or which is
prohibited by law. The facts in this year being identical to facts of
the A.Y. 2006-07, therefore, we direct the AO delete this addition
while computing income of the assessee society. Accordingly, this
ground of appeal is allowed.
65.    Ground no.15 is regarding addition of Rs.3,40,399/- on
account of investment in FDRs. The AO made an addition of
Rs.14,57,064/- on the basis of the observation by the Special
Auditor    that    assessee   has   made   investment   in   FDR    of
Rs.54,75,000/- whereas the assessee has disclosed investment of
Rs.40,17,936/-. On this basis an addition of Rs.14,57,064/- was
made by the AO. The CIT(A) after calling the remand report held
that there was investment in FDR of Rs.51,34,661/- with AICTE
which has       been   wrongly     confused with   another    FDR of
Rs.40,17,936/- . On this basis the CIT (A) restricted the addition
to Rs.3,40,339/-.
66.   On going through the facts we note that there are two FDRs
one   is   of     Rs.40,17,936/-    whereas   another   FDR    is   of
Rs.51,34,661/- with AICTE. The CIT(A) has considered this FDR
of Rs.51,34,661/- and has confirmed the balance amount of

                                    75
 Rs.3,40,339/- ignoring the other FDR appearing in the schedule
of investment of Rs.40,17,936/-. If we take into consideration
this FDR of Rs.40,17,936/- then the amount of investment in
FDR disclosed is more than the FDR investment considered by
the AO of Rs.54,75,000/-. In view of this the addition sustained
by the CIT(A) is untenable and we direct the AO to delete the
same. Accordingly this ground of appeal is allowed.
67.   Ground no.16 is regarding disallowance of depreciation of
Rs.6,35,842/-. This ground is identical to ground no.18 of
assessee's appeal for the A.Y. 2006-07. In the said appeal we
have in the absence of supporting evidence, upheld the
disallowance made by the CIT (A). However, we have held in
ground no.11 while considering disallowances in the absence of
supporting evidence that the income of the society is to be
computed in terms of section 11 of the Act and accordingly such
amount need to be excluded while computing total application of
income. Following the same reasoning we direct the AO that this
amount instead of making addition as income needs to be
excluded while considering application of income in terms of
section 11 of the Act. This ground of appeal is disposed of
accordingly.
68.       Ground no.17 and 18 are regarding computation of
income in accordance with the provision of section 11 and 12 of
the Act and not in accordance with the provisions of section 28 to
44 D of the Act. These grounds are identical to ground no.19 and
20 of assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07. There we have held that
income of the assessee society is to be computed in accordance


                                76
 with the provision of section 11 of the Act. Following the order
passed by us for the A.Y. 2006-07, we direct the AO to compute
the income in accordance with the provision of section 11 of the
Act and not in accordance with provision of section 28 to 44 D of
the Act. Ground no.17 and 18 are disposed of accordingly.
69.   Ground no.19 in assessee's appeal is regarding not
considering capital expenditure incurred during the year as
application   of   income   towards    charitable   purposes   while
computing income of the assessee society. This ground is
identical to ground no.21 in assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07.
In the said appeal we have held that as per section 11 income of
a eligible institution to the extent of which such income is applied
to charitable purposes in India is not be included in the total
income and the application of the income towards charitable
purposes include application towards acquisition of assets i.e.
capital expenditure. Following the same reasoning we direct the
AO to consider capital expenditure incurred during the year as
application   of   income   towards    charitable   purposes   while
computing income under section 11 of the Act. Ground no.19 is
accordingly allowed.
               Revenue's Appeal A.Y. 2007-08

70. Now we take up the appeal filed by the Revenue being ITA
No.4393/Del/2017. In the appeal filed with the Revenue it has
raised following grounds of appeal:-
71.    Ground no.1 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.27,98,909/- out of the total disallowance of
Rs.34,34,751/- made by the AO on account of the depreciation.
The AO has made the disallowance of depreciation on the
reasoning that the building was under construction as on
31.03.2007 and hence no depreciation can be allowed. The CIT
(A) has taken note of the fact that existence of the building was
not in doubt as the valuation officer appointed by the AO itself
has confirmed the same and the said report has also been relied
upon by the AO subsequently. On this basis the CIT (A) has
restricted the disallowance in respect of the addition at year end.
We are of the view that the fact building was in existence and was
in use is not in dispute and hence the CIT (A) was correct in
allowing depreciation on the building. The finding given by the
CIT (A) is correct and we see no reason to interfere with the order
of the CIT (A) and accordingly, this ground is dismissed.
 72.    Ground no.2 in Revenue appeal is regarding deletion of
addition   of   Rs.11,16,725/-   out   of   the   total   addition   of
Rs.14,57,064/- made by the AO on account of the unexplained
investment in FDRs. This addition has been made on the basis of
interpretation of observation of the special auditors report and is
common with ground no.15 in assessee's appeal whereby we
have deleted the addition sustained by the CIT (A). Following the
reasoning given in respect of ground no.15 in assessee's appeal,
we hold that no addition is called for on account of FDR.
Accordingly, this ground of the Revenue's appeal is dismissed.
73.    Ground no.3 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs21,25,428/- out of the total disallowance of
Rs.36,94,577/- made by the AO. The CIT(A) has deleted the
addition of Rs.21,25,428/- out of the Rs. 36,94,577/- as the
assessee has submitted additional evidences in respect of these
payments which have not been rebutted in the remand report by
the AO. The Assessee having submitted evidences and nothing
adverse being brought on record by the AO in the remand report
we are of the view that the CIT (A) was justified in deleting this
addition. Accordingly, the finding of the CIT (A) on this issue is
upheld and ground no.3 of Revenue's appeal is accordingly
dismissed.
74.          Ground no.4 is regarding deletion of addition of
Rs.2,38,385/- out of the total addition of Rs.2,61,197/- made by
the AO on the ground that the assessee did not file any
supporting document in support of its claim. The CIT(A) has
deleted the addition of Rs.2,38,385/- out of the Rs.2,61,197/- as

                                 79
 the assessee has submitted additional evidences in respect of
these payments    which has not been rebutted in the remand
report by the AO. The Assessee having submitted evidences and
nothing adverse being brought on record by the AO in the
remand report, we are of the view that the CIT (A) was justified in
deleting this addition. Accordingly, the finding of the CIT (A) on
this issue is upheld and ground no.4 of Revenue's appeal is
dismissed.
75.    Ground no.5 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.15,84,503/- out of the total disallowance of
Rs.29,33,699/- made by the AO on the ground of unsupported
expenditure. In the remand proceedings the appellant submitted
analysis of these expenditures along with the supporting bills
and vouchers. We note that the CIT (A) called for a remand report
and after examining the remand report held that a sum of
Rs.15,84,503/- is the double addition. Accordingly, the CIT (A)
deleted this amount and confirmed the balance. Since, the
disallowance has been deleted after considering the details
submitted by the assessee and examinedin the remand report we
do not find any reason to interfere with the order passed by the
CIT (A). Accordingly the order of the CIT (A) on this issue is
upheld and this ground of Revenue's appeal is dismissed.
76.    Ground no.6 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.8,49,930/- in respect of the cash deposited in the
bank. The CIT (A) noted that cash deposits added by the AO have
been duly recorded by the assessee in its books accounts. The
CIT (A) also noted that the Special auditor appointed by the AO

                                80
 has also not made any adverse observation about the cash
deposited in the bank. We are of the view that in the absence of
any mismatch being pointed out by the special auditor about the
amount shown in the books of account and the amount credited
in the bank account, the AO was not justified in making this
addition. From the assessment order it is evident that the AO has
made the addition merely on the ground that cash has been
deposited in the bank ignoring the fact that assessee receives
tuition fees etc. from the students and mere deposit in the bank
account cannot be a ground for making addition. The deposit in
the bank account having been made out of the books of accounts
the same cannot be considered to be unexplained deposits in the
bank account and accordingly we uphold the order of the CIT (A)
and dismiss this ground of Revenue's appeal.
77.   Ground no.7 of Revenue's appeal is general in nature and
hence need no adjudication.
78.    In the result, appeal of the assessee and of the Revenue is
partly allowed for statistical purposes.
                         A.Y. 2008-09

      ITA No.2733/Del/2018 and ITA No.4563/Del/2018
79.     First we take up the appeal of the assessee being ITA
No.2733/Del/2018.In this appeal the assessee has raised
following grounds of appeal:
  (ii)    In the absence of any supporting evidence, it was not
  justified in relying upon the balance sheet and Income and
  expenditure account filed before the bank.
11. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred, both on facts and in law, in ignoring the fact
  that having got the accounts audited from the special auditor
  there was no justification to take into consideration the figure
  stated in the balance sheet submitted to the bank, to be the
  basis of assessment.
12. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
  disallowance of an amount of Rs.2,28,318/- on account of
  unsupported expenditure.
13. On the facts and circumstances of the case the learned CIT(A)
  has erred both on facts and in law, in confirming the
  disallowance of an amount of Rs.23,500/- invoking the
  provision of section 40A(3).
14. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts & in law in confirming the
  disallowance an amount of Rs.3,61,855/- on the account of
  various expenses on the basis of special audit report.
15. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts & in law in confirming the
  disallowance of an amount of Rs.56,45,698/- invoking the
  provision of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act.
16. (i)   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
  disallowance of an amount of Rs.5,81,493/- on account of
  penalty.
    (ii)   That the disallowance was made ignoring the fact that
   the said amount does not pertain to penalty related to
   infraction of any statutory law.
 17. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
   CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
   addition of Rs.3,03,354/- on account of depreciation on
   building.
 18. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
   CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
   action of the A.O. in computing the income by applying
   provisions of section 28 to 44 D for computing profits and
   gains from business and profession, ignoring the fact that the
   assessee is a charitable institution and its income is to be
   computed on the basis of the provision of sections 11 and 12
   of the Act.
 19. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
   CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
   action of the A.O. in not computing the income in accordance
   with the provision of section 11 of the Act.
 20. On the facts and circumstance of the case, the learned CIT(A)
   has erred both on facts and in law, in not considering the
   capital expenditure incurred during the year while computing
   income of the assessee.
 21. The appellant craves leave to add, amend or alter any of the
   grounds of appeal.
80.   Ground No. 1 & 21 are general in nature and hence need
no adjudication; and on ground No. 2 to 5, no arguments were
addressed by the Ld. Counsel for the assessee and the same are
considered as not pressed and hence, dismissed.
81.   Ground nos.6 & 7 are regarding denial of exemption under
section 11 of the Act while computing income of the society. At
the time of hearing before us, both the parties fairly agreed that


                                84
 this ground raised and the facts in this appeal is identical to the
facts and ground no.6 raised in appeal for assessment year 2006-
07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017. Therefore, both the parties fairly
stated that the outcome of the appeal in ITA No.3674/Del/2017
for assessment year 2006-07 would be squarely applicable to
grounds no.6 & 7 of this appeal.
82.    We have already decided the appeal for assessment year
2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017 and, for the detailed
discussion in that appeal we have held that AO was not justified
in denying the benefit of the exemption under section 11 of the
Act and we have directed the AO to allow the benefit of section 11
of the Act and compute the income accordingly. Following the
same reasoning we hold that AO was not justified in denying the
benefit of exemption under section 11 of the Act and direct the
AO to compute the income in accordance with the provision of
section 11 of the Act. Ground no.6& 7 are accordingly allowed.
83.    Ground No. 8 to 11 in assessee appeal are regarding
computation of income by the AO on the basis of the Balance
Sheet and Income & Expenditure account submitted to the
Syndicate Bank for the purpose of obtaining loan facilities.
84.    At the time of hearing before us, both the parties agreed
that these grounds raised and the facts in this appeal is identical
to the facts and ground nos. 7 to 10 raised in appeal for
assessment year 2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017. Therefore,
both the parties fairly stated that the outcome of the appeal in
ITA No.3674/Del/2017 for assessment year 2006-07 would be
squarely applicable to these ground nos.8 to 11 of this appeal.
 85.    We have already decided the appeal for assessment year
2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017 and, for the detailed
discussion in that appeal we have held that the income and
expenditure account submitted by the assessee with the return of
income which has been audited by the special auditor should be
the basis for computing income as per provision of section 11 of
the Act. Following the same reasoning we hold that the income
and expenditure account submitted by the assessee with the
return of income which has been audited by the special auditor
shall be the basis for computing the income of the society in
accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Act. We direct
the   AO   accordingly.   Further,   as   regards   the   alternative
contention of the Ld. AR that in case balance sheet and income
and expenditure account submitted with the Syndicate Bank as
collateral security for obtaining bank loan is to be considered as
the correct financial of the assessee society, we are of the view
then the same has to be considered in entirety. The AO cannot
pick and choose certain figures from the financials which have
been audited and certain figures from the balance sheet with
Syndicate Bank. However, since, we have held that the balance
sheet and income and expenditure account which has been
audited by the special auditor shall be the basis for computation
of income, this alternative contention become academic in
nature. Ground nos.8 to 11 are accordingly allowed.
86.   Ground nos.12 & 14 are in assessee's appeal is regarding
confirmation of disallowance of an amount of Rs.2,28,318/- and
Rs.3,61,855/- respectively. These grounds are identical to the
ground no.11 in assessee's appeal for the A.Y. 2006-07 whereby
                                86
 we have upheld the disallowance of expenditure in respect of
which assessee has not been able to submit evidences. However,
as the assessee's income is to be computed in accordance with
the provisions of section 11 of the Act, we have directed the same
be excluded while computing income in terms of section 11 of the
Act. Following the same reasoning as the assesse has not
produced cogent evidence about these expenses of Rs.2,28,318/-
and Rs.3,61,855/- respectively, we direct the AO that this
amount instead of making addition as income need to be
excluded while considering application of income in terms of
section 11 of the Act. This ground of appeal is disposed of
accordingly

87.   Ground no.13 and 15 are regarding disallowance of
Rs.23,500/- by invoking the provision of section 40A(3) and
disallowance of Rs.56,45,698/- by invoking the provision of
section 40(a)(ia) respectively. These grounds are identical to the
ground no.14 in assessee's appeal for the A.Y. 2006-07. In the
said appeal we have held that income of the charitable institution
is to be computed under section 11 of the Act and hence
provision of section 28 to 44 D are not applicable. Following the
same reasoning we hold that no disallowance can be made while
computing income under section 11 of a charitable institution by
invoking provision of section 40A(3) and section 40(a)(ia).
Accordingly, ground nos. 13 and 15 are allowed.
88.   Ground no.16 is regarding disallowance of an amount of
Rs.5,81,493/- on account of penalty. This ground is identical to
the ground no.15 in assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07. In the

                                87
 said appeal we have deleted this disallowance holding that
Explanation to section 37 is not applicable while computing
income of charitable institution under section 11 of the Act and
further amount paid to bank will not fall within the meaning of
expenditure for any purpose which is an offence or which is
prohibited by law. The facts in this year being identical to facts of
the A.Y. 2006-07, accordingly, we direct the AO delete this
addition while computing income of the assessee society in terms
of section 11 of the Act. This ground of appeal is allowed.
89.        Ground no.17 is regarding disallowance of depreciation
of Rs.3,03,354/-. This ground is identical to ground no.18 of
assessee's appeal for the A.Y. 2006-07. In the said appeal we
have held that this amount need to be excluded while computing
income in terms of section 11 of the Act as assessee society has
not been able to substantiate its contention before the AO and
the CIT(A). Following the same reasoning we direct the AO that
this amount instead of making addition as income needs to be
excluded while considering application of income in terms of
section 11 of the Act. This ground of appeal is disposed of
accordingly.
90. Ground nos.18 and 19 are regarding computation of income
in accordance with the provision of section 11 and 12 of the Act
and not in accordance with the provisions of section 28 to 44 D of
the Act. These grounds are identical to ground no.19 and 20 of
assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07. There we have held that
income of the assessee society is to be computed in accordance
with the provision of section 11 of the Act. Following the order

                                 88
 passed by us for the A.Y. 2006-07 we direct the AO to compute
the income in accordance with the provision of section 11 of the
Act and not in accordance with provision of section 28 to 44 D of
the Act. Ground no.18 and 19 are disposed of accordingly.
91. Ground no.20       in   assessee's appeal is     regarding not
considering capital expenditure incurred during the year while
computing income of the assessee society. This ground is
identical to ground no.21 in assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07.
In the said appeal we have held that as per section 11 income of
a eligible institution to the extent of which such income is applied
to charitable purposes in India is not be included in the total
income and the application of the income towards charitable
purposes include application towards acquisition of assets i.e.
capital expenditure. Following the same reasoning we direct the
AO to consider capital expenditure incurred during the year as
application   of   income   towards    charitable   purposes   while
computing income under section 11 of the Act. Ground no.20 is
accordingly allowed.
               Revenue's Appeal A.Y. 2008-09

92.   Now we take up the appeal filed by the Revenue being ITA
No.4563/Del/2018. In the appeal filed with the Revenue it has
raised following grounds of appeal:-
93.   Ground no.1 in Revenue appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.10,12,427/- made by the AO on the ground of
unsupported expenditure. This addition was part of the total
disallowance of Rs.2,15,91,772/- made by the AO. In the remand


                                90
 proceedings the appellant submitted complete analysis of the
above along with the supporting bills and vouchers. We note that
the CIT (A) after examining the remand report noticed that a sum
of Rs.10,12,427/- is the double addition. Accordingly, the CIT(A)
deleted this amount. Since, the disallowance has been deleted by
the CIT (A) on the reasoning that this amount have been
considered twice and after considering the details submitted by
the assessee and examined in the remand report we uphold the
order of the CIT(A) and this ground is accordingly dismissed.
94.   Ground no.2 in Revenue appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.,6,31,330/- out of the total disallowance of
Rs.2,15,91,772/- made by the AO on account of unsupported
expenditure. The assessee in the remand proceedings has
submitted the details and has pointed out that this amount of
Rs.6,31,330/- is on account of capital expenditure and has not
been debited in the income and expenditure account. The CIT(A)
after considering the remand report and the details submitted by
the assessee has deleted this amount on the reasoning that
disallowance cannot be made when the same has not been
debited in the income and expenditure account. The Ld. DR has
not controverted the above fact. We are of the view that CIT (A)
has rightly deleted the addition after considering the remand
report. The expenditure having been not claimed in the income
and expenditure account the same cannot be added. That
disallowance can be made of such expenditure which has been
claimed as deduction. Accordingly, this ground of appeal is
dismissed.
 95.   Ground nos.3 and 4 are regarding deletion of addition of
Rs.13,20,948/- and Rs.1,83,98,749/- made by the AO on
account of unsupported expenditure. During the appellate
proceedings, the assessee submitted additional evidences along
with details of each of the expenditure incurred by it. The CIT (A)
on the basis of the additional evidences submitted by the
assessee called for the remand report. The first remand report
was submitted by the AO on 28.02.2013. In response thereto
assessee filed a rejoinder. The CIT (A) called for a further remand
report. In the remand proceedings the assessee again appeared
before the AO and submitted various details and evidences and
the AO submitted its second remand report dated 15.07.2013.
The assessee again submitted a rejoinder to this second remand
report. On the basis of the rejoinder the CIT (A) again called for
the remand report. In response thereto assessee again attended
the proceedings before the AO and further remand report was
submitted by the AO on 18.08.2015. The assessee during the
remand proceeding produced all evidences. The assessee has also
produced evidences in respect of the various expenses incurred.
The CIT (A) after considering the remand report submitted by the
AO and after examination of the document and evidences
submitted by the assessee has deleted the above addition. Thus,
the deletion has been made by the CIT (A) taking into
consideration all the facts and the details. Before us nothing has
been produced to controvert the finding of the CIT (A) and
accordingly we uphold the order of the CIT (A) deleting the above
additions. Ground nos.3 and 4 are accordingly dismissed.
 96.   Ground   no.5   is   regarding   deletion   of   addition   of
Rs.65,69,360/- on account of the various expenses out of the
total disallowance of Rs.69,62,076/- made by the AO. The CIT (A)
has deleted an amount of Rs.9,29,193/- and Rs.32,02,862/- on
the reasoning that no such expenditure has been claimed in the
income tax expenditure account and this was a book adjustment
having no income element. The CIT (A) has also recorded a
finding of the fact that the assesse has deposit with AICTE and it
is required to maintain certain amount as security. The CIT (A)
has also taken note of the fact that this payment is appearing on
the asset side of the balance sheet and hence cannot be
considered as a claim of Revenue expenditure. The CIT (A) has
deleted the addition also after taking into account that the AO
has not commented adversely with regard to AICTE in the
remand report. Thus, we are of the view that CIT (A) was correct
in deleting these two additions. The CIT (A) has further deleted an
amount of Rs.5,48,732/- appearing as freight and cartage
expenses whereas the same was on account of catering expenses.
This addition has been deleted by the CIT (A) after considering
the remand report and examination of the explanation and
evidences submitted by the assessee. Nothing contrary has been
pointed out by the Ld. DR and hence the deletion by the CIT (A) is
upheld. As regards the deletion of balance expenditure, from the
CIT(A) order we note that the CIT(A) has examined each and every
expenditure which was subject matter of disallowance by the AO
and has deleted that part of the expenditure in support of which
the assessee has been able to submit evidences in the remand
proceedings and has confirmed those expenditure in respect of

                                93
 which assessee could not submit evidences. The finding of the
CIT (A) has not been controverted before us. In view of these facts
we uphold the order of CIT (A) and accordingly ground no.5 of
Revenue's appeal is dismissed.
97.   Ground no.6 in Revenue's appeal deletion of addition of
Rs.3,59,90,244/- on account of investment in FDR. This addition
has been made by the AO by making a reference to the report of
the special auditor. However, while making the addition the AO
picked up the figure from the balance sheet with the Syndicate
Bank rather than the balance sheet as per the books of accounts.
During the appellate proceeding before the CIT(A), the assessee
brought to the notice that the observation of the special auditor
which nowhere     points   out   that   assessee   has   made   any
investment outside the books of accounts. The observation of the
special auditor was with reference to accrual of interest and the
details thereof. The submission of the assessee were forwarded by
the CIT (A) to the AO and AO in his remand report has not
controverted the contention of the assessee and has simply
reiterated what was stated in the assessment order. The CIT (A)
has taken into consideration the rejoinder submitted by the
appellant pointing out that the AO has wrongly interpreted the
finding of the special auditor and in fact special auditor has not
mentioned any investment outside the books of accounts. After
perusing the order passed by the AO and the CIT (A) and also
after going through the submission and the details submitted by
the assessee we are of the opinion that the CIT(A) has rightly
deleted the addition. The AO has incorrectly interpreted the
observation of the special auditor. In the special audit report
                                 94
 there is no allegation of any investment outside the books of
accounts. It appears that AO has simply picked up the figure
from the balance sheet with the Syndicate Bank and has on that
basis made addition ignoring the fact that the balance sheet
submitted by the assessee was subject matter of special audit
and assessment has to be completed on the basis of the said
balance sheet. We have already held while adjudicating ground
no.8 to 11 of the assessee's appeal that the basis for the
assessment has to be the balance sheet and income and
expenditure account which were subjected to special audit and
not the balance sheet and income and expenditure account filed
with the Syndicate Bank for collateral security for obtaining the
loan. Accordingly, we uphold the order of the CIT (A) and this
ground of appeal is dismissed.
98.   Ground no.7 in Revenue appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.2,30,68,487/- out of the total disallowance of
Rs.2,33,71,821/- made by the AO on account of the depreciation.
The AO has made the disallowance of depreciation on the
reasoning that the building was under construction as on
31.03.2008 and hence no depreciation can be allowed. The CIT(A)
has taken note of the fact that existence of the building was not
in doubt as the valuation officer appointed by the AO itself has
confirmed the same and the said report has also been relied upon
by the AO subsequently. On this basis the CIT (A) has restricted
the disallowance in respect of the addition during the year. We
are of the view that the fact building was in existence and was in
use is not in dispute and hence the CIT (A) was correct in
allowing depreciation on the building. The finding given by the
                                 95
 CIT (A) is correct and we see no reason to interfere with the order
of the CIT (A) and accordingly, this ground is dismissed.
99.    Ground no.8 in Revenue appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.5,00,000/- in respect of the cash deposited in the
bank. The CIT (A) noted that cash deposits added by the AO have
been duly recorded by the assessee in its books accounts. The
CIT(A) also noted that the Special auditor appointed by the AO
has also not made any adverse observation about the cash
deposited in the bank. We are of the view that in the absence of
any mismatch being pointed out by the special auditor about the
amount shown in the books of account and the amount credited
in the bank account the AO was not justified in making this
addition. From the assessment order it is evident that the AO has
made the addition merely on the ground that cash has been
deposited in the bank ignoring the fact that assessee receives
tuition fees etc. from the students and mere deposit in the bank
account cannot be a ground for making addition. The deposit in
the bank account having been made out of the books of accounts
the same cannot be considered to be unexplained deposits in the
bank account and accordingly we upheld the order of the CIT (A)
and dismiss this ground of appeal.
100.   Ground nos. 9 and 10 of Revenue's appeal are general in
nature and hence need no adjudication.
101. In the result, appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for
statistical purposes and appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
                        A.Y. 2009-10

                                96
     ITA No.2734/Del/2018 and ITA No.4564/Del/2018
102.    First we take up the appeal of the assessee being ITA
No.2734/Del/2018.In this appeal the assessee has raised
following grounds of appeal:
  (ii)     In the absence of any supporting evidence, it was not
  justified in relying upon the balance sheet and Income and
  expenditure account filed before the bank.
11. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred, both on facts and in law, in ignoring the fact

                                 98
   that having got the accounts audited from the special auditor
  there was no justification to take into consideration the figure
  stated in the balance sheet submitted to the bank, to be the
  basis of assessment.
12. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
  disallowance of an amount of Rs.14,86,474/- on account of

  has erred both on facts and in law, in confirming the
  disallowance of an amount of Rs.20,000/- invoking the

  CIT(A) has erred both on facts & in law in confirming the
  disallowance an amount of Rs.2,15,519/- on the account of

15. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts & in law in confirming the
  disallowance of an amount of Rs.1,04,74,647/- invoking the
  provision of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act.
16. (i)   On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
  disallowance of an amount of Rs.3,89,845/- on account of
  penalty.
  (ii)    That the disallowance was made ignoring the fact that
  the said amount does not pertain to penalty related to infraction
  of any statutory law.
17. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the

                                  99
   addition    of an amount of Rs.7,33,09,230/- on account of
  investment in FDR's under section 68 of the Income tax Act.
18. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
  addition of Rs.26,09,866/- on account of depreciation on
  building.
19. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
  addition of Rs.10,70,000/- on account of cash deposits in bank
  accounts.
20. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
  action of the A.O. in computing the income by applying
  provisions of section 28 to 44 D for computing profits and gains
  from business and profession, ignoring the fact that the
  assessee is a charitable institution and its income is to be
  computed on the basis of the provision of sections 11 and 12 of
  the Act.
21. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned
  CIT(A) has erred both on facts and in law in confirming the
  action of the A.O. in not computing the income in accordance
  with the provision of section 11 of the Act.
22. On the facts and circumstance of the case, the learned CIT(A)
  has erred both on facts and in law, in not considering the
  capital expenditure incurred during the year while computing
  income of the assessee.
23. The appellant craves leave to add, amend or alter any of the
  grounds of appeal.
 103. Again Ground No. 1 & 23 are general in nature and hence
need no adjudication; and ground Nos. 2 to 5, no arguments were
addressed by the Ld. Counsel for the assessee and the same are
considered as not pressed and hence, dismissed.
 104.     Ground nos.6 & 7 are regarding denial of exemption
under section 11 of the Act while computing income of the
society. At the time of hearing before us, both the parties fairly
agreed that this ground raised and the facts in     this appeal is
identical to the facts and ground no.6 raised in appeal for
assessment year 2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017. Therefore,
both the parties fairly stated that the outcome of the appeal in
ITA No.3674/Del/2017 for assessment year 2006-07 would be
squarely applicable to grounds no.6 & 7 of this appeal.
105.    We have already decided the appeal for assessment year
2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017 and, for the detailed
discussion in that appeal we have held that AO was not justified
in denying the benefit of the exemption under section 11 of the
Act and we have directed the AO to allow the benefit of section 11
of the Act and compute the income accordingly. Following the
same reasoning we hold that AO was not justified in denying the
benefit of exemption under section 11 of the Act and direct the
AO to compute the income in accordance with the provision of
section 11 of the Act. Ground no.6 & 7 are accordingly allowed

106. Ground No. 8 to 11 in assessee appeal are regarding
computation of income by the AO on the basis of the Balance
Sheet and Income & Expenditure account submitted to the
Syndicate Bank for the purpose of obtaining loan facilities.
 107.    At the time of hearing before us, both the parties agreed
that these grounds raised and the facts in this appeal is identical
to the facts and ground nos. 7 to 10 raised in appeal for
assessment year 2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017. Therefore,
both the parties fairly stated that the outcome of the appeal in
ITA No.3674/Del/2017 for assessment year 2006-07 would be
squarely applicable to these ground nos.8 to 11 of this appeal.
108.    We have already decided the appeal for assessment year
2006-07 vide ITA No.3674/Del/2017 and, for the detailed
discussion in that appeal we have held that the income and
expenditure account submitted by the assessee with the return of
income which has been audited by the special auditor should be
the basis for computing income as per provision of section 11 of
the Act. Following the same reasoning we hold that the income
and expenditure account submitted by the assessee with the
return of income which has been audited by the special auditor
shall be the basis for computing the income of the society in
accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Act. We direct
the    AO   accordingly.   Further,    as   regards   the   alternative
contention of the Ld. AR that in case balance sheet and income
and expenditure account submitted with the Syndicate Bank as
collateral security for obtaining bank loan is to be considered as
the correct financial of the assessee society, we are of the view
then the same has to be considered in entirety. The AO cannot
pick and choose certain figures from the financials which have
been audited and certain figures from the balance sheet with
Syndicate Bank. However, since, we have held that the balance
sheet and income and expenditure account which has been
                                 102
 audited by the special auditor shall be the basis for computation
of income, this alternative contention become academic in
nature. Ground nos.8 to 11 are accordingly allowed.
109.   Ground nos.12 & 14 are in assessee's appeal is regarding
confirmation of disallowance of an amount of Rs.14,86,474/- and
Rs.2,15,519/-    respectively   on    account    of   unsupported
expenditure. These grounds are identical to the ground no.11 in
assessee's appeal for the A.Y. 2006-07 whereby we have upheld
the disallowance of expenditure in respect of which assessee has
not been able to submit evidences. However, as the assessee's
income is to be computed in accordance with the provisions of
section 11 of the Act, we have directed the same be excluded
while computing income in terms of section 11 of the Act.
Following the same reasoning as the assesse has not produced
cogent evidence about these expenses of Rs.14,86,474/- and
Rs.2,15,519/- respectively ,we direct the AO that this amount
instead of making addition as income need to be excluded while
considering application of income in terms of section 11 of the
Act. This ground of appeal is disposed of accordingly.
110.    Ground no.13 and 15 are regarding disallowance of
Rs.20,000/- by invoking the provision of section 40A(3) and
disallowance of Rs.1,04,74,647/- by invoking provision of section
40(a)(ia) respectively. These grounds are identical to the ground
no.14 in assessee's appeal for the A.Y. 2006-07. In the said
appeal we have held that income of the charitable institution is to
be computed under section 11 of the Act and hence provision of
section 28 to 44 D are not applicable. Following the same

                                103
 reasoning we hold that no disallowance can be made while
computing income under section 11 of a charitable institution by
invoking provision of section 40A(3) and section 40(a)(ia).
Accordingly, ground nos. 13 and 15 are allowed.
111.       Ground no.16 is regarding disallowance of an amount
of Rs.3,89,845/- on account of penalty. This ground is identical
to the ground no.15 in assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07. In the
said appeal we have deleted this disallowance holding that
Explanation to section 37 is not applicable while computing
income of charitable institution under section 11 of the Act and
further amount paid to bank will not fall within the meaning of
expenditure for any purpose which is an offence or which is
prohibited by law. The facts in this year being identical to facts of
the A.Y. 2006-07, accordingly, we direct the AO delete this
addition while computing income of the assessee society in terms
of section 11 of the Act. This ground of appeal is allowed.
112.   Ground no.17 is regarding addition of Rs.7,33,09,230/- on
account of investment in FDRs. The AO has made an addition of
Rs.20,85,06,326/- on account of unexplained investment in
FDRs and interest thereon. The CIT (A) has restricted addition to
Rs.7,33,09,230/-This addition has been made by the AO by
making a reference to the report of the special auditor. However,
while making the addition the AO picked up the figure from the
balance sheet with the Syndicate Bank rather than the balance
sheet as per the books of accounts. During the appellate
proceeding   the   assessee   brought   to   the   notice   that   the
observation of the special auditor which nowhere points out that


                                 104
 assessee has made any investment outside the books of
accounts. The observation of the special auditor was with
reference to accrual of interest and the details thereof. The
submission of the assessee were forwarded by the CIT(A) to the
AO and AO in his remand report has not controverted the
contention of the assessee and has simply reiterated what was
stated in the assessment order. The CIT (A) has taken into
consideration the rejoinder submitted by the appellant pointing
out that the AO has wrongly interpreted the finding of the special
auditor and in fact special auditor has not mentioned any
investment outside the books of accounts. However, the CIT(A)
instead of deleting the entire addition surprisingly took into
consideration the income and expenditure account with the
Syndicate Bank and on that basis after deducting income shown
therein has confirmed the balance amount as unexplained
investment. After perusing the order passed by the AO and the
CIT(A) and also after going through the submission and the
details submitted by the assessee we are of the opinion that the
CIT(A) has gone wrong in drawing adverse inference on the basis
of the balance sheet and income and expenditure account with
Syndicate Bank ignoring the balance sheet and income and
expenditure account which has been subject matter of special
audit.In fact the AO has incorrectly interpreted the observation of
the special auditor. In the special audit report there is no
allegation of any investment outside the books of accounts. The
observation was limited to computation of accrued interest on
FDR. There is no allegation of anyunexplained investment in
FDR. The AO has simply picked up the figure from the balance

                                105
 sheet with the Syndicate Bank and has on that basis made
addition ignoring the fact that the balance sheet submitted by the
assessee was subject matter of special audit and assessment has
to be completed on the basis of the said balance sheet. We have
already held while adjudicating ground no.8 to 11 that the basis
for the assessment has to be the balance sheet and income and
expenditure account which were subjected to special audit and
not the balance sheet and income and expenditure account filed
with the Syndicate Bank for collateral security for obtaining the
loan. Thus, we hold that the addition made on the basis of
balance sheet with Syndicate Bank is unsustainable and
accordingly, we direct the AO to delete this addition. In the result
this ground no.17 of appeal is allowed.
113.   Ground no.18 is regarding disallowance of depreciation of
Rs.26,09,866/-./-. This ground is identical to ground no.18 of
assessee's appeal for the A.Y. 2006-07. In the said appeal we
have held that this amount need to be excluded while computing
income in terms of section 11 of the Act as assessee society has
not been able to substantiate its contention before the AO and
the CIT(A). Following the same reasoning we direct the AO that
this amount instead of making addition as income needs to be
excluded while considering application of income in terms of
section 11 of the Act. This ground of appeal is disposed of
accordingly.
114.      Ground no.19 is regarding confirmation of addition of
Rs.10,70,000/- in respect of the cash deposited in the bank. The
AO made this addition on the basis of the cash deposited in the

                                106
 bank account. The CIT (A) has confirmed the addition despite
deleting similar addition in the preceding assessment year. In the
preceding year the CIT (A) has held that the Special auditor
appointed by the AO has not made any adverse observation
about the cash deposited in the bank. However, in this year the
facts being identical still the CIT (A) took a different view and held
that assessee has not satisfied him about the source of such
deposit. We are of the view that in the absence of any mismatch
being pointed out by the special auditor about the amount shown
in the books of account and the amount credited in the bank
account the CIT(A) was not justified in confirming this addition.
Had there been a mismatch between the books of accounts and
the bank statement, the special auditor would have stated so.
From the assessment order it is evident that the AO has made
the addition merely on the ground that cash has been deposited
in the bank ignoring the fact that assessee receives tuition fees
etc. from the students and mere deposit in the bank account
cannot be a ground for making addition. The deposit in the bank
account having been made out of the books of accounts the same
cannot be considered to be unexplained deposits in the bank
account and we direct the AO to delete this addition. This ground
of appeal is accordingly allowed.
115.    Ground nos.20 and 21 are regarding computation of
income in accordance with the provision of section 11 and 12 of
the Act and not in accordance with the provisions of section 28 to
44 D of the Act. These grounds are identical to ground no.19 and
20 of assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07. There we have held that
income of the assessee society is to be computed in accordance
                                 107
   with the provision of section 11 and 12 of the Act. Following the
  order passed by us for the A.Y. 2006-07, we direct the AO to
  compute the income in accordance with the provision of section
  11 and 12 of the Act and not in accordance with provision of
  section 28 to 44 D of the Act. Ground no.20 and 21 are disposed
  of accordingly.
 116. Ground no. 22 in assessee's appeal is regarding not
  considering capital expenditure incurred during the year while
  computing income of the assessee society. This ground is
  identical to ground no.21 in assessee's appeal for A.Y. 2006-07.
  In the said appeal we have held that as per section 11 income of
  a eligible institution to the extent of which such income is applied
  to charitable purposes in India is not be included in the total
  income and the application of the income towards charitable
  purposes include application towards acquisition of assets i.e.
  capital expenditure. Following the same reasoning we direct the
  AO to consider capital expenditure incurred during the year as
  application   of   income   towards    charitable    purposes   while
  computing income under section 11 of the Act. Ground no.19 is
  accordingly allowed. Ground no.22 is accordingly allowed.
Revenue's Appeal A.Y. 2009-10

  Now we take up the appeal filed by the Revenue being ITA
  No.4564/Del/2018.
  117.   In the appeal filed with the Revenue it has raised following
  grounds of appeal:-
  as assessee has also failed to substantiate the expenses with
  proper bills/vouchers.
4. That the Ld. CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the
  addition   of   Rs.67,06,750/-       on   account   of   unsupported
  expenditure as documents and vouchers filed by assessee have
  failed to pass the test of veracity.
5. That the Ld. CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the
  addition of Rs.1,40,64,916/- on account of payment made to
  M/s Ansal Housing Construction. However, the assessee has
  failed to substantiate the genuineness of the transaction.
6. That the Ld. CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the
  addition of Rs.9,59,321/- on account of cash received from
  Campus Business School as the assessee has not submitted
  any documentary evidence to prove the genuineness the
  transaction.
7. That the Ld. CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the
  addition of Rs.4,28,693/- as some of the bills of expenditure

                                 109
    were in the name of other concern as the assessee has failed to
   substantiate the expenses claimed.
8. That the Ld. CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the
   addition of Rs.13,51,97,096/- on account of investment in FDR
   under section 68 of the Act as the assessee failed to
   substantiate the source of income.
9. That the Ld. CIT(A) has erred in law and on facts in deleting the
   addition of Rs.2,07,61,955/- on account of depreciation on
   building as assessee was unable to file any document in
   support of its claim of the depreciation.
10. That the order of the Ld. CIT(A) be cancelled and the order of
   the A.O. be restored.
118.     Ground no.1 in Revenue appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.63,88,462/-. The above disallowance was part of
the total disallowance of Rs.2,30,48,689/- made by the AO on the
ground of unsupported expenditure. In the remand proceedings
the appellant submitted complete analysis of the above along
with the supporting bills and vouchers. We note that the CIT(A)
after examining the remand report noticed that a sum of
Rs.63,88,462/- is the double addition. Accordingly, the CIT (A)
deleted this amount. On going through the order passed by the
CIT(A) and the paper book we note that the assessee in the
remand    proceedings      has   given   complete   details   and   the
reconciliation voucher wise pointing out the same amount being
added twice. Before us nothing has been produced to controvert
the findings recorded by the CIT (A). The disallowance has been
deleted by the CIT (A) on the reasoning that this amount has
been considered twice and after considering the details submitted

                                   110
 by the assessee and examined in the remand report. Accordingly,
we uphold the order of the CIT(A) and dismissed this ground of
the Revenue's appeal.
119.   Ground no.2 in Revenue appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.,67,22,420/- out of the total disallowance of
Rs.2,30,48,689/- made by the AO on account of unsupported
expenditure. The assessee in the remand proceedings has
submitted the details and has pointed out that this amount of
Rs.67,22,420/- is on account of capital expenditure and has not
been debited in the income and expenditure account. The CIT(A)
after considering the remand report and the details submitted by
the assessee has deleted this amount on the reasoning that
disallowance cannot be made when the same has not been
debited in the income and expenditure account. In the ground
raised before us it has been stated that CIT(A) has wrongly
treated the expenditure as capital in nature. We have gone
through the details quoted in the CIT(A) order and also the
submission and the details filed before CIT(A) which were subject
matter of remand proceedings. On going through the same it is
evident that the expenses are capital in nature and have not been
claimed in the income and expenditure account and CIT(A) has
rightly deleted the addition after examination in the remand
proceeding. The expenditure having been not claimed in the
income and expenditure account the same cannot be added.
Accordingly, this ground of Revenue's appeal is dismissed.
120.   Ground nos.3 and 4 are regarding deletion of addition of
Rs.17,44,403/- and Rs.67,06,750/- made by the AO on account

                               111
 of unsupported expenditure. During the appellate proceedings,
the assessee submitted additional evidences along with details of
each of the expenditure incurred by it. The CIT (A) on the basis of
the additional evidences submitted by the assessee called for the
remand report. The first remand report was submitted by the AO
on 28.02.2013. In response thereto assessee filed a rejoinder. The
CIT(A) called for the further remand report from the AO.
Consequent, thereto the assessee again appeared before the AO
in the remand proceedings and submitted various details and
evidences. The AO submitted second remand report dated
15.07.2013. The assessee thereafter again submitted a rejoinder.
On the basis of the rejoinder the CIT (A) again called for the
remand report. In response thereto assessee again attended the
proceedings before the AO and further remand report was
submitted by the AO on 18.08.2015. The assessee during the
remand proceeding has produced all possible evidences. The
assessee has also produced evidences in respect of the various
expenses incurred. The CIT(A) after considering the remand
report and the explanation and evidences submitted by the
assessee deleted the above addition. Thus, the deletion has been
made by the CIT(A) taking into consideration all the facts and the
details. The above finding of the CIT(A) has not been controverted
before us and accordingly we uphold the order of the CIT(A)
deleting the above additions. Ground nos.3 and 4 of Revenue's
appeal are accordingly dismissed.
121.      Ground no.5 is regarding deletion of addition of
Rs.1,40,64,916/- on account of the payment made to M/s Ansal
House Construction. This addition was made on the basis of the
                                112
 observation that no supporting evidences in support thereof was
provided by the assessee. During the remand proceedings the
assessee submitted copy of the supporting evidences which were
examined by the AO and no adverse remark was given in the
remand report. The CIT (A) has deleted addition holding that
firstly the assessee has submitted the evidences and moreover
such expenditure being capital and having not been claimed in
the income and expenditure account the same cannot be subject
matter of disallowance. Before us nothing has been brought to
controvert the finding of the CIT (A). The assessee having
submitted the evidence in support of the amount incurred and
that too on capital account there was no reason for making
disallowance. Accordingly, we uphold the order of the CIT (A) and
dismiss this ground of appeal.
122.      Ground no.6 is regarding deletion of addition of
Rs.9,59,321/-. The AO made this addition on the reasoning that
such expenditure pertains to campus school which is different
than the assessee. The CIT(A) has deleted the addition holding
that the expenses pertains to Campus school which is part of the
assessee itself.Further the bills are also in its own name and
nothing adverse has been commented by the AO in the remand
report. Before us also no material has been brought to controvert
the finding of the CIT(A). Accordingly, we uphold the order of the
CIT(A) and dismiss this ground of appeal.
123.   Ground no.7 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.4,28,693/-.The AO has made this addition on the
ground that the amount has been debited under a wrong head.
 During the remand proceedings the assessee has explained that
it was a inadvertent error whereby the amount has been debited
to a wrong head but the fact remains that the expenditure has
been incurred. The CIT (A) has deleted the addition on the
reasoning that mere wrong posting of an entry of expenditure in
the books of accounts cannot be a ground to disallow the same.
We are of the view the expenditure having been actually incurred
the same cannot be disallowed merely because it has been
debited under a different head of the expenditure. The CIT (A)
accordingly was right in deleting the addition and this ground of
appeal is accordingly dismissed.
124.   Ground no.8 in Revenue's appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.13,51,97,096/- on account of investment in FDR.
This ground is common with ground no.17 of assessee's appeal
where part addition were sustained by the CIT(A). While
adjudicating ground no.17 of the assessee's appeal we have held
that addition made on the basis of the balance sheet with the
Syndicate Bank for obtaining loan cannot be sustained. Following
the same reasoning as given in ground no.17 of assessee's appeal
this ground of the Revenue's appeal is dismissed.
125.    Ground no.9 in Revenue appeal is regarding deletion of
addition of Rs.2,07,61,955/- out of the total disallowance of
Rs.2,33,71,821/- made by the AO on account of the depreciation.
The AO has made the disallowance of depreciation on the
reasoning that the building was under construction as on
31.03.2009 and hence no depreciation can be allowed. The CIT
(A) has taken note of the fact that existence of the building was

                               114
 not in doubt as the valuation officer appointed by the AO itself
has confirmed the same and the said report has also been relied
upon by the AO subsequently. On this basis the CIT (A) has
restricted the disallowance in respect of the addition during the
year. We are of the view that the fact building was in existence
and was in use is not in dispute and hence the CIT (A) was
correct in allowing depreciation on the building. The finding given
by the CIT(A) are correct and we see no reason to interfere with
the order of the CIT(A) and accordingly, this ground is dismissed.
126.     Ground nos. 10 and 11 of Revenue's appeal are general in
nature and hence need no adjudication.
127.       In the result, appeal of the assessee is partly allowed for
statistical purposes and appeal of the Revenue is dismissed.
128.      In view of our finding given above, the assessee's appeals
are partly allowed for statistical purposes and Revenue's appeals
are dismissed.
       Pronounced in the open court on 28th June,2019.

2. Whether it would be released under Rule 27 of		:
3. Whether their Lordships wish to see the fair		        :
    4.	    Whether order is to be circulated to the Department	:
      It is in terms of this sub-rule that the appellant have paid an amount of 5%/ 10% of the value of exempted goods. Admittedly such payment already stands made by the appellant to the Revenue and stands recovered by them from their customers. When said 5%/ 10% amount recovered by the appellants from their customers, already stands paid to the Revenue, I really fail to understand as to why same would become additional consideration and part of the assessable value.  It may not be out of place to mention here that 5%/ 10% amount in terms of said rule is required to be paid and not reversed from the cenvat credit account inasmuch as the expression used in the said rule is payment of amount.  They payment may be made through cenvat credit account or through PLA. But the fact remains that it is payment of an amount which is equal to particular prescribed percentage of the value of the exempted goods. As such payment which already stands made to the Revenue can never be held to be an additional consideration recovered from their customers towards value of the goods. 
11.	In fact I find that an identical question was the subject matter of the larger bench decision of Tribunal in the case of Unison Metal Vs.CCE, Ahmedabad-I-2006 (204) ELT 323 (Tri.-LB).  While considering the question as to whether 8% payment made by the assessee in terms of Rule 57CC of erstwhile Central Excise Rules, 1944 at the time of removal of the goods and recovered by them from their customer would attract the provisions of section 11D. The larger bench by observing that no amount collected from the buyers remains unpaid to the , irrespective of the fact whether the same were represented in the sales documents as duty or not  and as such the provision of section 11D would not be attracted. The only difference in the Unison decision and the present case is that in that case demand was made under section 11D whereas in the present case, recovered amount is sought to be added in the assessable value and consequent duty demand is made. 
12.	Based upon the decision of the larger bench in the case of  Unison Metal Ltd., the Board also issued a Circular No.870/8/2008-Cx, dated 16.5.2008.  Paras 3 & $ of the said circular are being reproduced for ready reference as under:- 	
13.	As is seen from the above, it stands clarified that as long as the amount 8% or 10% is paid to the Government in terms of Rule 57CC of the erstwhile of Central Excise or Rule 6 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, the provisions of section 11D shall not apply even if the amount is recovered from the buyers. If that be so, the said amount recovered from the buyer can also not be added to the assessable value.
14.	Apart from the above fact, I find that the issue is squarely covered by the larger bench decision of the Tribunal and there are no justifiable reasons to take a different view. I also note that Honble Supereme Court in the case of CCE, Meerut vs. Kisan Sahkari Chinni Mills Ltd.-2001 (132) ELT 523 (SC) has held that in the absence of a definition of taxes in the Central Excise Act, 1944, expression tax is to be given a broad meaning and it would cover any levy. Administrative charges required to be paid by sugar factory for molasses sold and recovered from the customer in terms of section 8(5) of the Uttar Pradesh Sheera Niyantaran Adhiniyam, 1964 being compulsory extraction made under enactment was held to be a duty or impost in the nature of a tax, covered by section 4(4)(d)(ii) of Central Excise Act, 1944. Similarly, the Tribunal in the case of Sujanta Metal Products vs. CCE, Hyderabad-2009 (243) ELT 542 (Tri.) has held that an amount of 10% paid under Rule 6 of Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 is to be considered as tax,  in terms of interpretation of Honble Delhi High Court in the case of Bombay Conductors & Electricals Ltd. vs. Union of India-1986 (23) ELT 87 (Del.) As such, it is seen that in terms of said decision, the amount paid under Rule 6 have been held to be widely covered by expression tax.  If that be so, recovery of tax amount from the customer, which already stands paid to the Revenue cannot be held to be liable to be added in the assessable value of the goods.
15.	Be as it may be, the fact that recovered amount already stands paid to the Revenue in terms of Rule 6 (3) (i). The demand of duty on the same amount by treating it as part of the assessable value is not in accordance with the said rule. 
16.	I have taken a different view from my learned brother on merits of the case but I agree with him on the point of limitation and penalty.  As such, I am of the view that the impugned order is required to be set aside in its totality and the appeal is required to be allowed.

Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.      This appeal by way of special leave has been filed against the

concurrent judgments of conviction of the Sessions Court and the High

Court by which the appellant, Rupchand has been sentenced to undergo

imprisonment for life for having committed the murder of Parasram

Bhoyar, resident of village Pathari, police station Goregaon.
                                    2
      The facts of the appeal are as under:

      We have perused the evidence of PW.4 Dr. Satish Jaiswal.        The

post mortem examination itself is tell tale and indicates some very

significant facts.   Column 12 of the form talks about the body being

highly decomposed, Column 13 refers to the fact that insects and

Maggots were crawling all over the face, whereas column 19 (iii) reveals

that the brain was absent and that Maggots were crawling in the skull

cavity. The Doctor also deposed that in his opinion the death had

occurred about 60 hours before the post-mortem examination but in
                                     6


cross-examination he modified his statement to say that it could be less

than 60 hours but not less than 48 hours under any circumstances. We

have also gone through the inquest report which is equally revealing and

refers to the fact that Maggots were crawling all over the body and that

the anus was swollen and that the skin thereat had peeled off.



      Relying on the aforesaid information gathered from the prosecution

evidence Mr. P. Ramesh Kumar, the learned counsel for the appellant

has submitted that the eye witnesses account was not borne out by the

medical evidence. He has referred us the MODI's Medical Jurisprudence

and Toxicology, Twenty-third Edition pages 438-440.         We find from a

perusal thereof that the rectum and uterus protrude within 48 to 70

hours after death.   Likewise we see from the chart on page 438 that

Maggots come on to the body within a minimum of 24 hours 18 minutes

and a maximum of 76 hours, making an average of 39 hours 43 minutes.

We must, accordingly, take the average as the basis of our decision and,

therefore, observe that the death had occurred atleast 40 hours before

the body was first examined at the time of the inquest report on 14 th

May, 1999. It is also significant that while dealing with the condition of

the brain after death this is what Modi says with regard to its

putrefaction : (Page-440):

It is sufficient if the facts in W.P. No. 1608 of 1967 are mentioned. The petitioner in W.P. No. 1608 of 1967 is the Hyderabad Allwyn Metal Works Limited. In compliance with Section 46 of the Factories Act of 1948 and the Rules made thereunder, the petitioner provides and maintains a canteen for the use of the workers. The petitioner-company submitted a provisional return to the Commercial Tax Officer, First Circle, Hyderabad, in Form A-2 under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act. The Commercial Tax Officer, noticing that the turnover relating to the sales at the canteen had not been included in the return, issued a notice on 26th October, 1966, proposing to include the sales of food and drink at the canteen in the turnover of the petitioner for the purpose of provisional assessment. The petitioner was asked whether it had any objection to the same. The petitioner submitted objections on 30th November, 1966, stating that the sales at the canteen could not be included in the turnover of the petitioner as they were not made in the course of its ""business"", but were made in order to comply with the requirements of statute. The Commercial Tax Officer, however, did not agree with the objections of the petitioner and included the sales at the canteen  in the turnover. The petitioner preferred an appeal to the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, but his appeal was rejected on 18th February, 1967. The petitioner preferred an appeal to the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal raising the question of vires of Sections 2(bbb), 2(n) and 5-A of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act. On the ground that it may not be competent for the petitioner to question the vires of the provisions of the statute before the Tribunal, the petitioner has filed the present application for the issue of a writ of certiorari to have the order of the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes dated 18th February, 1967, confirming the order of the Commercial Tax Officer, quashed.
2. Having regard to certain recent judgments of the Supreme Court, the vires of Sections 2(bbb),'2(n) and 5-A was not questioned before us at the hearing. The principal submission of Sri D. Venkatappayya Sastry, learned counsel for the petitioner, was that the petitioner was compelled by statute to provide and maintain a canteen for the use of the workers, that the canteen was not run with a profit-motive but was merely intended to provide amenities to workers and, therefore, it could not be said that there were any sales when food and drink were supplied to workers at the canteen. According to the learned counsel, the petitioner never carried on ""business"" and never intended to carry on any business in food and drink.
3. It is necessary to trace the course of legislation as well as judicial precedent in order to appreciate the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner. Under the Madras General Sales Tax Act of 1939, which was in force in the Andhra area of the State of Andhra Pradesh till 1957, and under the Hyderabad General Sales Tax Act of 1950, which was in force in the Telangana area of the State of Andhra Pradesh till 1957, the word ""business"" was not denned, but sale was denned in so far as it is relevant to mean, with all grammatical variations and cognate expressions, every transfer of property in goods by one person to another in the course of trade or business for cash or for deferred payment or for other valuable consideration. A dealer was denned as meaning any person carrying on the business of buying, selling, supplying or distributing goods directly or otherwise. Neither the definition of sale nor the definition of dealer indicated that a profit-motive was not necessary. ""Business"" was not originally denned in the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act of 1957, but it came to be denned by an amending Act of 1966 to which we shall refer later. In Gannon Dunkerley and Co. v. The State of Madras [1954] 5 S.T.C. 216 at 242, a question arose before the High Court of Madras whether the assessee-company which was engaged in the business of execution of contracts for construction of buildings, bridges, etc., was liable to pay tax on the value of the food-grains which it supplied to its workmen for the benefit of the workmen on a non-profit basis. The cost of the food-grains supplied to the workmen was debited against their wages. Satyanarayana Rao and Rajagopalan, JJ., observed that the word ""business"" must be understood in a commercial sense as involving an activity to earn profit and held that the supply of food-grains to the workers by the company was not carried out with a view to earn profit and in fact no profit accrued and, therefore, the company was not liable to pay sales tax.     In the course of their discussion they observed :
4. Later again they observed :
5. In Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. State of Madras [1954] 5 S.T.C. 291 the assessee was a company engaged in the business of manufacture of textiles. The company ran a canteen for the benefit of its employees where food and refreshments were sold on a non-profit basis. The canteen was run in pursuance of the requirements of Section 46 of the Factories Act and the Rules made thereunder. On those facts, Satyanarayana Rao and Rajagopalan, JJ., came to the conclusion that it was impossible to consider the assessee as a dealer in respect of the turnovers relating to the sale of food-stuffs and refreshments as the company did not carry on business and as the sales were not in the course of any trade or business of the assessee within the meaning of the General Sales Tax Act. The learned Judges referred to their earlier judgment in the case of Gannon Dunkerley  and Co. Ltd. v. The State of Madras [1954] 5 S.T.C. 216 and reiterated their earlier conclusion that the word ""business"" was used in the Act in the commercial sense, an integral part of which was the motive to make profits by sales or purchases, and if this was wanting, a person buying or selling would not be a ""dealer"". The decision of the learned Judges was therefore based on the circumstance that there was no profit-motive involved in the sales and not on any theory that the sales were compulsory sales made in order to comply with  statute.
6. In The Trustees of the Port of Madras v. The State of Madras [1960] 11 S.T.C. 224 the facts were that under the Port Trust Act, the Port Trust was under an obligation to supply water to ships calling at the Madras harbour. The Port Trust, which was supplied water by the Corporation of Madras at certain rates, in its turn supplied water to ships calling at the port on payment of charges. The question arose whether the Port Trust Act could be subjected to sales tax on the supply of water to ships. On an examination of the Port Trust Act, the learned Judges came to the conclusion that the Madras Port Trust was not ""conceived as a commercial body for making profits by sale of goods"" and that ""no profit-motive could be implied in the levy of charges for the water supplied to the ships"". The learned Judges referred to the earlier decisions of the Madras High Court in Gannon Dunkerley and Co. v. State of Madras [1954] 5 S.T.C. 216 and Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. State of Madras [1954] 5 S.T.C. 291 and held that in order to-become liable to sales tax a dealer should be one who buys and sells goods with the object or intention of making a profit. They held that as there was no profit-motive in the supply of water by the Port Trust, sales tax was not leviable. They referred to the statutory obligation of the Port Trust to supply water but that was only to emphasise the lack of  a profit-motive.
7. In I.C.F. Canteen v. Deputy Commercial Tax Officer [1962] 13 S.T.C. 827 the question arose whether sales of food and drink to the workmen of the assessee at the canteen maintained by the assessee in pursuance of Section 46 of the Factories Act and the Factories Rules could be assessed to sales tax. Veeraswami, J., held that the Factories Rules showed that there was ""a complete absence of profit-motive in the service by the canteen to its workers, of food and drink at controlled charges"". The learned Judge held that the assessee was not a dealer as it did no ""business"" in a commercial sense with a view to make profit. It was pointed out to the learned Judge that ""business"" was defined by the Madras Sales Tax Act of 1959 and that under the new Act, actual accrual of profit was not essential. The learned Judge rightly observed that it was never thought that actual accrual of profit was necessary. What was necessary was a profit-motive and the Act of 1959, therefore, did not alter the legal position.
8. In 1964, the definition of ""business"" in the Madras General Sales Tax Act of 1959 was amended and this definition was incorporated almost verbatim in the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act of 1957 by an amendment in 1966. The definition in the Madras Act is as follows :
9. After the amendment of 1964 the question arose in Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes v. Thirumagal Mills Limited [1967] 20 S.T.C. 287 whether the assessee, a cotton yarn manufacturing company could be assessed to sales tax on the ""turnover"" relating to a fair price shop run by the assessee for the benefit of its employees. Notwithstanding the amended definition of ""business"", Veeraswami and Ramaprasada Rao, JJ., held that the assessee could not be assessed as the assessee was not ""carrying on the business of selling commodities in the fair price shop in a trade or commercial sense"". The amended definition of ""business"" was considered in the following manner:
10. We find ourselves unable to   agree   with the  learned   Judges.     We think   that   the  learned Judges have not paid sufficient attention to the word  ""such""   occurring   in   the   second  part   of  the   definition.     ""Such trade,  commerce,   manufacture,   adventure   or   concern""  must obviously refer to the ""trade, commerce, manufacture, adventure or concern"" mentioned in the first part of the definition, that is to say, ""trade, commerce, manufacture, adventure or concern"" of which a motive to make gain or profit is not an essential requisite. We do not think that it is permissible to hold that there was no ""business"" in the commercial sense of ""business"" with a motive to make profit, when such motive has-been expressly declared unnecessary by the Legislature. We think that under both parts of the definition, profit-motive is now immaterial and the concept of ""business"" in the commercial sense put forward and accepted in the earlier cases must now be abandoned. We, therefore, hold that in the present cases too, in view of the definition of ""business"" introduced into the Andhra Pradesh Act by the amendment Act of 1966, proof of profit-motive is unnecessary to constitute ""business"".
11. The next submission of Sri Venkatappayya Sastry was that even if profit-motive was not now an ingredient of ""business"", it must still be established that the assessee intended to do business in food and drink before it could be subjected to the levy of sales tax. According to Sri Venkatappayya Sastry, what was done by the assessee was done under compulsion because the provisions of the Factories Act made it penal for the assessee not to provide and maintain a canteen for the use of the workers. Sales of food and drink effected at the canteen were ""compulsory"" and not voluntary sales and it could not, therefore, be said that the petitioner intended to do any business by supplying food and drink at the canteen to their workers. We do not agree with the learned counsel for the petitioner that to obey the law is to be compelled to do a thing. It would indeed be a most pernicious principle to say that a person does not intend to do a thing merely because he does that thing in obedience to the law and to advance the law. It may be that the law puts him in peril if he does not do the thing, but that does not mean that when he does it, he does not intend to do it. The compulsion, or it may be more appropriate to say, the inducement resulting from the fear of penal consequences is not a compulsion which would vitiate a contract. Under Section 14 of the Contract Act, a consent is said to be free when it is not caused by (1) coercion, as defined in Section 15, or (2) undue influence, as defined in Section 16, or (3) fraud, as defined in Section 17, or (4) misrepresentation, as defined in Section 18, or (5) mistake subject to the provisions of Sections 20, 21 and 22. Section 15 defines coercion as ""committing or threatening to commit, any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code, or the unlawful detaining, or threatening to detain any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement.""
12. A contract is said to be induced by undue influence where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.     This is how undue influence is defined in Section 16 of the Indian Contract Act. It is clear that the supply of food and drink by the company to its workmen was not the result of coercion or undue influence as defined in Sections 15 and 16 of the Contract Act.
13. The learned counsel relied on the decisions of the Supreme Court in New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar [1963] 14 S.T.C. 316 (S.C.) and The State of Gujarat v. Raipur Manufacturing Co. Ltd. [1967] 19 S.T.C. 1 (S.C.) In the first case the facts were that the assessee despatched sugar to the authorised agents of the State of Madras in compliance with the direction issued by the Sugar Controller exercising powers under the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1946. The Sales Tax Officer, Darbhanga, included the value of the sugar so despatched in the taxable turnover of the petitioner. Their Lordships of the Supereme Court held that since there was never any negotiation between the manufacturer and the State of Madras and the sugar was despatched pursuant to the direction of the Controller, there was no offer and no acceptance and, therefore, there was no contract of sale. It was, therefore, held that the turnover relating to the despatch of sugar by the company to the State of Madras could not be included in the taxable turnover of the company.     Their Lordships  observed :
14. This case is not of any real assistance to the petitioner because it was a case whore the company and the Government never met face to face or through an agent. There was never any privity of contract between them. We do not think when their Lordships said that a contract of sale postulated exercise of volition on the part of the contracting parties and that in complying with the orders passed by the Controller, there was no such exercise of volition, their Lordships intended to lay down any broad proposition that there could never be a contract of sale when the parties were merely complying with statutory directions. This position was made clear by their Lordships themselves in later cases to which we shall presently refer. The decision in New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar [1963] 14 S.T.C. 316 (S.C.) was a decision peculiar to the facts of that case and is not an authority for. the general proposition for which the learned counsel for the petitioner contended. In the present case, the facts are altogether different. The. company and the workmen come together every time when an article of food or drink is sold and the price is paid for it. There is a privity of contract between the company and the workmen whenever an article of food or drink is supplied and the price for it is received.
15. In The State of Gujarat v. Raipur Manufacturing Co. Ltd. [1967] 19 S.T.C. 1 (S.C.) their Lordships held that a company which disposed of miscellaneous old and discarded items could not be said to have carried on the business of selling those items of goods.     It was observed :
16. We do not see how this decision assists the petitioner. All that their Lordships laid down was that an intention to carry on business must be inferred from circumstances such as volume, frequency, continuity and regularity of the transactions of purchase and sale and that on the facts of the case before them no such intention could be inferred. In the present case  all the circumstances indicated by their Lordships of the Supreme Court as throwing light on the intention to carry on business are present.
17. We may now refer to three other decisions of their Lordships of the Supreme Court. The first of these cases, Indian Steel and Wire Pro-duels Limited v. Stale of Madras A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 478 was concerned with the question whether the supply of certain products by the assessee to various persons, under orders of the Controller exercising powers under the Iron and Steel (Control of Production and Distribution) Order of 1941, could be included in the taxable turnover of the assessee. The contention of the assessee was that it was the province of the Controller to determine the persons to whom the goods were to be supplied, the price at which they were to be supplied, the manner in which they were to be transported and the mode in which flu: payment of the price was to be made and, therefore, there was no volition on the part of the assessee, and the supplies could not constitute sales within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act. Their Lordships while holding that the circumstances pointed out by the assessee existed, observed that it would not be correct to say that tin.: transactions were completely regulated and controlled by the Controller leaving no room for mutual assent because all orders were booked subject to the assessee's terms of business and general understanding in force at the time of booking the orders and despatching the goods, and it was also open to the appellant to fix the time and mode of payment of the price of the goods supplied. On that finding, their Lordships held that the transactions were sales and were rightly included in the taxable turnover of the assessee. Hegde, J., speaking for the court referred with approval to a passage in the ''Law of Contract"" by Cheshire and Fifoot where the learned authors stated : ""The background of the contract law, social, political and economic has changed. Laissez-faire; as an ideal has been supplanted by 'social security'  ; and social security suggests status rather than contract. The State may thus compel persons to make contracts, as where, by a series of Road Traffic Acts from 1930 to 1960, a motorist must insure against third-party risks; it may, as by the Kent Restriction Acts, prevent one party to a contract from enforcing his rights under it; or it may empower a Tribunal either to reduce or to increase the rent payable under a lease. In many instances a statute prescribes the contents of the contract. The Money-Lenders Act, 1927, dictates the terms of any loan caught by its provisions; the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924, contains six pages of rules to be incorporated in every contract for 'the carriage of goods by sea from any port in Great Britain or Northern Ireland to any other port' ; the Hire-Purchase Act, 1938, inserts into hire-purchase contracts a number of terms which the parties are forbidden to exclude ; successive Landlord and Tenant Acts from 1927 to 1954 contain provisions expressed to apply 'notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary'."" 
18. Hegde, J., then proceeded to state :
19. Referring to the case of New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar [1963] 14 S.T.C. 316 (S.C.) it was observed :
20. In Andhra Sugars Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 599 the facts were that under the Andhra Pradesh Sugar-cane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act and the Rules made thereunder, a cane-grower in a factory zone was free to sell or not to sell sugar-cane to the factory. He might consume it or he might process it into jaggery and then sell the finished product. If he offered to sell his cane, the occupier of the factory was bound to enter into an agreement with him on the prescribed terms and conditions and to buy cane, pursuant to the agreement, in conformity with the instructions issued by the Cane Commissioner. The assessee-factory contended that as it was compelled by law to buy cane from the cane-growers, the purchases were not made under agreements and were not taxable under entry 54, List II, Schedule VII of the Constitution. Their Lordships repelled the argument stating :
21. Referring to the case of New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar [1963] 14 S.T.C. 316 (S.C.) Bachawat, J., observed :
22. In State of Rajasthan v. Karam Chand Thappar and Bros. [1969] 23 S.T.C. 210 (S.C.), their Lordships of the Supreme Court reiterated what was stated in Indian Steel and Wire Products Limited v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 478 and Andhra Sugars Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 599. It is unnecessary to refer to the facts of the case. It is clear from these decisions that the mere fact that goods are supplied pursuant to statutory directions does not make the supplies not ""sales"" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act and for the purpose of the Sales Tax Act. In order that a transaction may not be a sale, it seems to be the opinion of their Lordships, the whole of the transaction must be controlled by statute. In the present case, though the company was under an obligation to provide and maintain a canteen for the use of the workers and though the running of the canteen was to be subject to the Rules made under the Factories Act, the transactions were not regulated solely by statute. There was a large amount of freedom left to the parties. Section 46 of the Indian Factories Act merely obliges a factory to provide and maintain a canteen for the use of the workers. It also provides for the making of Rules regarding (1) the food-stuffs to be served in  the canteen and charges which may be made therefor, and (2) the constitution of a managing committee and representation of the workers in the management of the canteen. Rules were made under Section 46 of the Act. Rule 68 provides that food, drink and other items served in the canteen shall be served on a non-profit basis and that the prices charged shall be subject to the approval of the canteen managing committee. If the committee did not approve the price-list, the price-list was to be sent to the Chief Inspector of Factories for approval. Rule 70 provides for the constitution of a managing committee who consists of an equal number of persons nominated by the factory and elected by the workers. The committee is to be a consultative committee in the matter of, ""(1) quality and quantity of food-stuffs to be served in the canteen, (2) the arrangement of the menus, (3) the times of meals in the canteen, and (4) in other matters as may be directed by the committee."" It is thus seen from the Act and the Rules that while the occupier of a factory is obliged to maintain, a canteen and serve food and drink on a non-profit basis, there is a large amount of discretion in all other matters such as the choice of food and drink to be served, the prices at which they may be served, the time when they may be served, etc. In these matters, the voice of the managing committee, half the members of which are the occupier's own nominees, is to be that of an adviser only. Having regard to these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the transactions of supply of food and drink to workmen in the canteen maintained by the company, in pursuance of the Indian Factories Act and the Rules, are sales and do constitute business for the purposes of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act.
23. In the result, the writ petitions are dismissed with costs.   Advocate's fee Rs. 100 in each.

"Hajee Ismail Said And Son (Pvt.)

Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.1. This is   an   appeal from the judgment and order of D.N. Sinna, J. discharging the Rule obtained by the appellant company in respect of 246 of its workmen.
2. The significant point for determination in this Appeal is whether termination of service in accordance with the Standing Orders is always and necessarily a retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act, and if it is not so always, in which cases such termination is retrenchment.
3. The petitioner is a private limited company carrying on business in the manufacture of country spirit and rectified and denatured spirit. This business is exercised and can only be exercised in terms of an Excise license issued to the petitioner appellant and under its terms the Government fixed the price of the spirit and sanction from the Commissioner of Excise was necessary in order to exceed such a price. The workmen employed by the petitioner company are opposite party No. 4, and are represented by the Russa Distillery Workers' Union. There is another Union by the name of the Bussa Distillery  Employees' Union which represented 87 of the workers.
4. The events involved in this dispute relate back to the incidents that happened in 1959. It is the appellant's case that on the 23rd April, 1959, the situation was such that the appellant was compelled to close the Distillery. Then there was an agreement between the appellant and its workmen. A brief account of these facts may be helpful at this stage. The workmen after a strike notice dated the 9th March, 1959, on the issues relating to the retrenchment and change of service conditions struck work from the 9th April, 1959. The Management notified to the workmen on the 23rd April, 1959 of their decision to close the factory for the reasons stated in that notice. The dispute was then taken up in conciliation proceedings. The Management was thereafter informed by the Excise Directorate that they would be receiving a certain quantity of molasses in a year although that meant a reduction of their previous quantity. The Management thereafter decided to reopen the establishment with about 64 workmen, The workmen not having agreed to accept the offer of the management, the Establishment could not be reopened. After discussion in conciliation proceedings on the 21st May and 22nd May, 1959, a certain Agreement was reached on or about the 25th May, 1959. The essence of this agreement is that the Establishment shall reopen on the 25th May, 1959, with all workmen on roll on the 8th April, 1959, and this complement will work until the 30th May, 1959 on their normal wages. From the 1st June, 1959, the daily complement of workmen in the establishment would be 100 and the establishment would work on weekly rotation basis and another complement of 100 would be replaced each week. The list was to be drawn up jointly by the management and the Union. It was also agreed that in working out the programme of work, the workmen who would be out of employment from the 1st June, 1959, should be considered as on lay off and was entitled to the lay off benefits. The attempt, however, to work this agreement did not succeed for reasons beyond the, control of the appellant.
5. The main reason for the failure of this agreement' was that the Excise Department of the Government failed to supply the quantity of molasses and did not renew the license for the manufacture and sale of the country spirit Without these two, it was natural that this particular business in distillery could not be carried on. The foundation on which the agreement could be worked failed. In fact the appellant's case is that there was no work for these workers. The facts are stated in the appellant petitioner's notice dated the 9th April, 1959.
6. This notice was followed by the notice of termination of service which the appellant petitioner gave to its workmen. The notice of termination is dated the 10th July, 1959 and reads as follows:
7. This is the termination which started the present Industrial dispute out of which this appeal arises.
8. The matter was referred to the Industrial Tribunal on the issue ""Whether the retrenchment of the 313 workmen, (names given in the attached list) is justified? To what relief, if any, are they entitled?""
9. Neither parly adduced any oral evidence before the Tribunal but relied on the documents. It is admitted by the Tribunal in its Award that there was no controversy on the point that the company had terminated the services of 313 workmen and that only a skeleton staff out of the total complement of 340 workmen had been retained. The Tribunal appears to come to the conclusion that this termination was retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act and as such the workmen were entitled to compensation as provided in Section 25F of that Act. The Tribunal awarded compensation to all the workmen.
10. The first mistake that the Tribunal made in its award was its failure to notice that 67 workmen out of this total number were represented by another Union who never raised a dispute and these 67 workmen had taken what was given to them in full satisfaction of their dues. That objection was expressly taken by the appellant company before the Tribunal and in support of which an affidavit also was filed giving the particulars and names of these 67 workmen. The Tribunal never even mentioned that fact far less decide that question. If 67 workmen had taken their dues in complete satisfaction, there could be no industrial dispute in respect of the same of which the Tribunal could make an award. The affidavit of Basanta Chowdhury on record is a part of the evidence. Naturally the learned Judge rightly quashed the Award in respect of these 67 persons and made the Rule absolute in respect of these 67 workmen.
11. With regard to the rest of the workmen, the learned Judge discharged the Rule on the ground that he did not like to interfere with what he described as the conclusion of fact arrived at by the Tribunal that the termination in this case was retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act.
12. The whole question in this appeal is whether the termination of service in the present case is retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The main defence of the appellant petitioner all through was that this was not a retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act at all and that it was a case of termination under the conditions laid down in the Standing Orders. That is not a question of fact in this case but a question of law, In fact there was no dispute on questions of fact and nobody gave any oral evidence in these proceedings at any stage.
13. Numerous decisions have been cited before us on this point at great length. Before discussing at least some of these decisions it will be appropriate to have a good look at the sections of the Industrial Disputes Act relevant for this purpose.
14. Section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act contains the definitions. The definitions are as usual subject to ""anything repugnant in the subject or contest"". The crucial definition on which the decision of this appeal turns is of retrenchment in Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act defining retrenchment in the following terms: ""'Retrenchment' means the termination by the employer of the service of a workman for any reasons whatsoever, otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action, but does not include:
15. On behalf of the workman it has been contended that the definition is an unqualified and unmitigated definition covering all termination of service for any reason whatsoever with the three limited exceptions made in Sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) above. For the appellant company the contention is that it is not such unqualified definition. The expression ""termination of the service of a workman for any reason whatsoever' appearing in Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act contains within itself its own limitations. Such limitations are that such termination must be a termination for a ""reason"" In other words the words ""termination"" and ""reason' imply a certain amount of volition and choice and free action on the part of the employer. If that volition or free choice is not available by compelling circumstances which leave no option to the employer but to terminate the service, then in such a case termination is not within the real significant ambit and connotation of the words ''termination for any reason whatsoever"" if the objective situation is such that both the termination and the reason are beyond the control of the employer, then termination in that context would not be retrenchment. Therefore, while all retrenchment is termination of service. all termination is not retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The appellant Company's case is that termination under specified conditions laid down by the Standing Orders is not necessarily and always a retrenchment.
16. The present judicial opinion seems to Favour the view that some limitation must be imposed on the apparently wide definition in Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act defining retrenchment to mean termination by the employer of the service of the workmen for any reason whatsoever save and except the exceptions expressly made therein. Obviously termination of service as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action is not retrenchment, as it is expressly excluded by the definition. Similarly, retrenchment either voluntarily or reaching superannuation age even though it terminates the service is not a retrenchment. So termination of service on the ground of continued ill-health is not retrenchment. The other case of termination of service where it is not retrenchment is when the termination is not in the volition, option and free choice of the employer or within the control of his reason. If the situation is compelling then termination in such force of circumstance's is not retrenchment.
17. The Supreme Court in Hariprasad Shivshankar Shukla v. A.D. Divelkar, reported in AIR 1957 SC 121 expressed the following view at p. 132:
Therefore, the bounds of the ordinary connotation should not bo excelled on the ground of amplitude of expression used. The Supreme Court was definite also in observing at the same page as follows :
In other words the Supreme Court lays down that unless business is continuing or running there is no question of any retrenchment. In this case the admitted fact is that, without license and without molasses, the business of the company could not run and in fact this business had closed on the 23rd April, 1959 and the attempt to reopen it by mutual agreement for reasons stated above could not succeed. Indeed the appellant employer tried its best to revive the business but could not clue to the refusal of the Government lo grant license at the relevant time and supply the molasses, which were the very raw materials for the business. Therefore the distillery could not be continued or run and hence according to the test laid down by the Supereme Court this termination cannot he etrenchnient.
18. The Supreme Court had again occasion to discuss the question of retrenchment in Hathising Manufacturing Co Ltd. v. Union of India,  and upheld the constitutional validity of Section 25FFF of the Industrial Disputes Act, a point which does not arise in the Appeal before us.
19. But this question came up again in connection with Standing Orders in a number of cases in the Supreme Court. In Nagpur Electric Light and Power Co. Ltd. v. K. Shreepathirao,  the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the discharge of the employees by the Company in that case. The Supreme Courl took the view that the Standing Orders applied to the workmen and that was decisive of the question. The following observations relevant for the decision in this appeal before us were made by the Supreme Court at p. 664:
20. If that test is applied then a termination under the Standing Orders and in compliance thereof would not be retrenchment. The actual Standing Order in this case reads as follows:
In  the  case  of  monthly     paid  permanent workmen, probationers and apprentices and those who have completed 240 days work during the calendar year one month's notice will be neces sary.
It will be optional for the employer to pay wages for the notice period in lieu of notice. No notice shall be necessary in the case of other badli, temporary or casual workmen.
2. Where the employment of any workman is terminated all wages earned and unpaid shall be paid to him at the lime of discharge, if convenient, or in any case, within the period of time prescribed by the Payment of Wages Act 1936.""
21. Now this is Clause 13 of the Standing Orders of the appellant Company. It is certified under Section 5(3) of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 and was so since the 17th of March, 1958. It is binding on both the appellant company and workmen concerned. That means one month's notice is necessary for the termination as well as one month's pay in lien of notice.
22. No doubt the Standing Order should not be used for termination as a colourable device for defeating retrenchment compensation under Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act. In such a case termination purporting to be under the Standing Order could not be really a termination under the Standing Order but a fraud upon it and a fraud upon the statute.
23. In fact the Supreme Court in the Chartered Bank. Bombay v. Chartered Bank Employees' Union  lays down the principle that the Industrial Tribunal can always go behind the form of the order and see whether it is a mere camouflage for a dismissal for misconduct without following the prescribed procedure. Where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unneces sarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man, that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice. This point was further considered by the Supreme Court in Management of U.B. Dutt and Co. (Private) Ltd. v. Workmen of U.B. Dutt and Co. (Private) Ltd. . The principle laid down by the Supreme Court in that case is that the company cannot rest its case merely on Standing Order and say that having acted under that rule there was nothing more to be said and that the Industrial Court could not inquire into the causes that led to the termination of service under the Standing Order. The ratio of this decision is that the Industrial Court has the right to inquire into the causes that might have Ted to termination of service, and if it was satisfied that the action taken under such a Standing Order was a colourable exercise of power and was not bona fide or was a result or victimisation or unfair labour practice it would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination. In that particular case the Tribunal had held that the exercise of power was colourable.
24. In the instant case before us there is no question at all of any colourable or mala fide exercise of power or of victimisation or unfair labour practice. In the absence of such circumstances it would appear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the Standing Order and a bona fide action under the Standing Order is not liable to be interfered with.
25. The Standing Orders have a sanctity and importance of their own. It is idle to say that they are mere parts of a contract or private agreement between labour and the management. They have got certain statutory implications under the Standing Orders Act. There is a very limited scope in such Standing Orders of one party victimising the other. The Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act 1946 has the primary object of requiring employers in industrial establishments formally to define conditions of employment under them. The Standing Orders must be made by the employers. It is a compulsory legal duty. The draft must be submitted for consideration by the Certifying Officer (Section 3). It is the function of the Certifying Officer who is the statutory authority or the appellate authority under the Act to adjudicate upon the fairness or reasonableness of the provisions of the Standing Order (Section 4). It is only then that the certification follows of the Standing Order under Section 5. There are even appeals provided before the Appellate Authority. There has to be a Register of Standing Orders. The Standing Orders must be posted at the most important places and on special gates of the establishment. These Standing Orders finally certified under the Act shall not, except on agreement between the employer and the workmen, be liable to modification until the expiry of six months. Thereafter modifications may be sought in the Standing Orders either by the employer or by the workmen. Indeed there are penalties provided for the acts and conduct in contravention of these provisions, This much, therefore, is clear that the whole procedure is statutory with the tripartite participation of the employer, the workmen and the authorities under the Act, and should not be confused with or reduced to a mere private contract between a stronger party and a weaker party. The grounds on which the Courts have allowed Industrial Tribunals to interfere with contractual arrangement between employer and employees in cases of private agreements, may not be available in interfering with action under the Standing Orders, except in the limited oases mentioned because of the statutory procedure providing protection by public authorities and the participation of both the workmen and the employer in the ultimate formulation of the Standing Orders.
26. The Supreme Court in Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. v. Venkatiah,  made some important and relevant observations on the poiut under consideration by us. It is laid down by the Supreme Court in that decision that the certified Standing Orders represent the relevant terms and conditions of service in a statutory form and they are binding on the parties at least as much, if not more, as private contracts embodying similar terms and conditions of service. Indeed the ratio of that decision is that the question of abandonment or relinquishment of service should be decided by consideration of such relevant terms and conditions of service and not by the doctrine of common law or considerations of equity. See the observations of the Supreme Court at page 1275.
27. No doubt it is always open to the employees to raise a dispute and ask the Standing Orders to be amended for instance in Guest, Keen, Williams P. Ltd. v. P.J. Sterling, . The issue in that case was whether the system of forced retirement of workmen at the age of 55 introduced by the management by its Standing Orders was justified. In dealing with an issue of that kind the Tribunal certainly had to consider not only the property, reasonableness and fairness of the rule. but it had also to deal with the question whether the said rule could and should be made applicable to employees who had already been employed by the appellant in service without any limitation as to the age of retirement. It is necessary, however, to point out that the issue was directly raised there and placed before the Tribunal (which it has not been done in the present case before us) and also before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decision was given on facts before the amendment of 1956, when if the employees wanted to challenge the reasonableness or fairness of any Standing Orders the only course open to them was to raise an industrial dispute in that matter and the Supreme Court observed at page 1283 of the report  as Mows:
28. It is necessary to emphasise that the schedules to Industrial Disputes Act also have an important bearing on this question. The Standing Orders are expressly mentioned in items 1 and 2 of the second schedule, item 6 of the Third Schedule, and items 6 and 9 of the Fourth Schedule. Item 1 of the Second Schedule of the Industrial Disputes Act reads as follows:
29. After all the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 is a special statute with regard to the conditions of employment and lays down a special procedure as to its formulation and modification. It was not intended that a number of institutions, authorities and administrative agencies should thereafter be working at cross purposes and dealing with the same problem for that would lead not only to conflicts of decisions, but utter confusion in the field.
30. The law has been indicated and laid down by the latest decision of the Supreme Court in Murugan Mills Ltd. v. Industrial Tribunal, Madras . The right of the employer to terminate the services of his workman under the Standing Orders by giving a notice or by paying him wages in lieu of such notice which amounts to a claim ""to hire and fire"" an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication, was considered by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in 1951-2 Lab LJ 314 (L. A. T. I. - Cal.) and the view taken therein was approved in the decision of the Supreme Court in  and . There also the Supreme Court emphasised that even in such a case the requirement of bona fides was essential. If the termination of service was a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice the Industrial Tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination. The form of the order in such a case is not conclusive. In that case before the Supreme Court the services of the concerned employee were terminated under the relevant standing order without assigning any reasons.
31. Now if these tests be applied to the present appeal before us we are bound to hold that this was not a case of ""hiring and firing"" at all. In fact even the Tribunal itself had to come to the finding that the retrenchment was justified. It could only be justified on the grounds--
32. We are inclined to lake in this context the view of the Standing Orders taken by the Madras decision in Mettur Industries Ltd. v. A.R. Varma . A learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court there takes the view that reading the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, as a whole it is clear that the standing orders form part of the contract between the Management and every one of its employees. In tact he lakes the view that these Standing Orders take the place of the service rules relating to Government servants. Standing Orders cannot be ignored and they are binding and effective between the parties. There is in that context no scope for the application of the principle of natural justice to a relationship where the rights of parties are provided for and determined by statutes, rules framed under the statutes and other statutory instruments. II lays down that the Labour Courts are the creatures of statute and they have no power or authority whatever except those conferred by the relevant statutes which have been passed from time to time. Balkrishna Ayyar, J. who decided that case at p. 484 of the report observed as follows:
 The learned Judge there in the Madras decision took the view that termination in conformity with the conditions of the contract between the parties under the standing orders was not always and necessarily a retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act. We respectfully agree with that view.
33. It is not necessary here at this stage to discuss in detail the view taken by the Bombay High Court in Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. Labour Appellate Tribunal of India.  on the point that retrenchment is discharge of surplus labour or staff following the Supreme Court decision in (S) AIR 1957 SC 121. But then in the Bombay decision in Devidayal Nanakchand v. State Industrial Court Nagpur,  it has been said that the definition of 'retrenchment' in Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act though an artificial one is certainly very wide and would include termination of services even in pursuance of the Standing Order. It is laid down by the Bombay decision that the observance of the provisions of Section 25F is a condition precedent to retrenchment of a workman to whom this section applies. One part of this decision is no longer good law having regard to the Supreme Court decision that the payment of compensation under Section 25F is not a condition precedent. The other part of the decision is also not in our opinion contrary to the view and interpretation we are laying down.
34. The Supreme Court decisions have laid down that even termination of services under the Standing Orders can in certain circumstances, such as colourable exercise of power, unfair labour practice or victimisation or mala fide, could be retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act. But outside such cases, termination under the Standing Order is not retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act.
35. That is why this Court is of the opinion that while all retrenchment is termination of service all termination of service is not retrenchment under Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act. It depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Mere invocation of the Standing Order for termination of service will not ipso facto take the termination beyond the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal under the Industrial Disputes Act, for that Tribunal will even then in appropriate cases have jurisdiction to find that the invocation of the Standing Order was capricious or arbitrary or mala fide or was the result of victimisation or unfair labour practice and set aside the termination or award compensation as under retrenchment as the facts may justify. In other words, termination under the: Standing Order is not necessarily and always retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act. To come to any other conclusion in our opinion, would be meaningless for that would practically repeal the validity of the standing orders on the point of termination of service and payment of compensation, a result which we do not think was intended either by the Industrial Disputes Act or by the Standing Orders Act.
36. In the case of Workmen of Dewan Tea Estate v. Their Management    the Supreme Court again     emphasised  the  importance of the Standing Orders and discussed the question  of  conflict between   the   Act  and   the Standing Order.   But then there    the question turned more on the ambit of Section 2(kkk) dealing  with  lay-off,   with  which  we  are not  concerned in the present appeal.
37. The Tribunal and the judgment under appeal mention the fact of closure. Closure however, was not the case made by the appellant company. The point about closure is really taken here in the ground of appeal before us. It is only material in computing the compensation under Section 25FFF of the Industrial Disputes Act because it limits in the proviso the amount of compensation in this way:
 It is not necessary for us to discuss in detail the arguments about closure. The appellant contends that both the Tribunal and the learned fudge went wrong in coming to a conclusion that there was no closure. The notice dated the 9th July, 1959, definitely stated that there was no work for the workmen in the distillery. A skeleton staff only was working. The immediate history also shows that from the 23rd April, 1959 there was in fact a closure and on agreement on the 25th May, 1959 to revive the business became abortive on the grounds mentioned above Therefore, the appellant contends that on these admitted facts which were on the record before the Tribunal and before the learned Judge and there being no oral evidence disputing the facts, the decision should at least have been that it was a closure as an irresistible inference from these admitted facts. It was not a question whether they made a case of closure. The appellant submits that it could not make a case of closure and it did not on the ground that its whole case proceeded on the ground that it was a case of termination under the express provision of Clause 13 of the Standing Orders Act and therefore, they invoked the Standing Orders to terminate the services. It is not necessary for them to plead closure in that context.
38. We are satisfied that the appellant's defence under Clause 13 of the Standing Orders must be upheld in this case independently of any question of closure. The appellant, therefore, is only liable to pay in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in Clause 13 of the Standing Order.
39. We shall make only a passing reference on this point to Section 25J of the Industrial Disputes Act. It only provides that the provisions of this Chapter VA dealing with layoff and retrenchment under the Industrial Disputes Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law including standing orders made under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act 1946. As we have held that it is not retrenchment nor lay-off, the provisions of this Chapter VA consequently have no application whatever.
40. If we had come to a different conclusion that this termination was retrenchment within the meaning of Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act even then we would have come to the conclusion that in am event Section 25FFF could have applied to the rase of the appellant on the ground that from the surrounding circumstances the only possible conclusion would be that there was in fact a closure of the business of the distillery under proviso to Sub-section (1) thereof.
41. We shall make here a reference to the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in Pipraich Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Pipraich Sugar Mills Mazdoor Union, . The Supreme Court in that case laid down us follows:
But the Supreme Court there lays down this wholesome principle:
 Therefore, the Supreme Court says that--
 ...Where the business has been closed down and it is either admitted, or found that the closure is real and bona fide, any dispute arising with reference thereto will fall outside the purview of the Industrial Disputes Act. And that will a fortiori be so, if a dispute arises--if one such can be conceived, after the closure of the business between the quondam employer and employees"".
On that principle the Supreme Court in that case set aside the award of compensation to the workmen made by the Tribunal. As already pointed out here, what else can be said in the case of a distillery business where the very license under which it was being carried on was not granted and the very raw materials on which it is prepared was not supplied. Those are admitted facts in this case, The natural inference which could be drawn from the surrounding circumstances in that event would have been to hold that it was a closure.
42. This conclusion is all the more reinforced by the fact that the appellant company was anxious to start the work in some form or other even with 100 workmen on rotation basis provided the licence was obtained and the raw materials were supplied. But neither eventuality helped the appellant company actually to start the business and lift the closure. Observations to the same effect were also made by the Supreme Court in Banaras Ice Factory Ltd. v. Its Workmen, . Although that was not a case of closure out the Supreme Court reiterated the view that the objects mentioned above can have fulfilment only in an existing and not a dead industry.
43. For these reasons we set aside the judgment of the Industrial Tribunal. We also set aside the judgment and order of D.N. Sinha, J. in so far as he discharged the Rule but confirm his judgment in so far as he made the Rule absolute in respect of 67 workers represented by the Russa Distillery Employees' Union. In other words, the order of D.N. Sinha, J. discharging the Rule in respect of the remaining 246 workmen represented by the Russa Distillery Workers' Union is set aside and a Writ in the nature of certiorari quashing the Award in respect of them do issue.
44. There is a cross-appeal by the respondent opposite part) No. 4 in respect of these 67 workers. For reasons already stated in this judgment the cross-appeal is dismissed.
45. There  will  be  no order   as  to  costs either in this appeal or in the cross-appeal.
Masud, J.   
 46. I agree.

The petitioners are the owners of an immoveable property known as ""Bhadran Bhuvan"" situate at Tardeo Junction, which they purchased on May 10, 1.940. The immoveable property consists inter alia of several shops, shops Nos. 10 to 14 whereof are the subject-matter of these proceedings. It is not stated in the petition what was the position of these shops after May 10, 1940, up to the time that the same came to be occupied by the respective parties, the only averments in the petition in this behalf which were considered relevant by the draftsman of the petition being that shop No. 10 was let out to one Sakhavat Hussein on or about June 1, 1943, at a rental of Rs, 80 per month, that the front portion of shop No. 11 was given to one Tukaram Tavde for occupation by leave and license of the petitioners on or about June 1, 1943, Tukaram Tavde paying a compensation for such use and occupation at the rate of Rs. 35 per month, that shop No. 12 was let out to one Ramchandra & Co. on or about November 1, 1944, at a rental of Rs. 80 per month, that shop No. 13 was let out to Messrs, Friendly Stores on or about May 1, 1943, on a rental of Rs. 80 per month, and that shop No. 14 was let out to one Khodadad R. Irani on or about September 1, 1943, at a rental of Rs. 115 per month. The petition does not state who were the tenants, if at all, between May 10, 1940, and the various dates above mentioned when the occupation of these various parties commenced. After setting out the parties in occupation of the several shops and when they came to occupy the same as aforesaid, the petition proceeds to state that in about December, 1943, a joint application was made by Messrs. Khodadad E. Irani. Messrs. Friendly Stores, Tukaram Tavde and one P.D. Yajnik, who was the then occupant of shop No. 12, to the respondent for fixing the standard rent of the premises respectively occupied by them but that the application was dismissed by the respondent on or about January 3, 1944, on the ground that he had no jurisdiction to decide the same. Nothing further appears to have transpired until November 21, 1945, when the present occupants of the shops Nos. 10 to 14 abovementioned made a joint application to the respondent, the terms whereof are relevant to note. They stated that they were occupying a shop galas Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of a big shop situate in ""Bhadran Bhuvan"" and belonging to the petitioners, that the said shops which were numbered by the petitioners conveniently as shops Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 formed a single tenement in. September; 1940, and prior to that the rent charged for that single tenement which was let out to one Sorab B. Tata was Us, 120 per month which Mas the standard rent of the tenement, that the petitioners had, with a view to circumvent the provisions of the law, got that tenement divided by temporary (kutcha) wooden partitions into five tenements and had let out the same to them charging them respectively Rs. 80, Rs. 35, Rs. 80, Rs. 80 and Rs. 115 making in all Rs. 390, and that according to them the standard rent of the galas in their occupation came to Rs. 30, Rs. 10, Rs. 20, Rs. 20 and Rs. 30, respectively making in all Rs. 110. They, therefore, requested the respondent to institute necessary inquiries in the matter and fix up the standard rent of the tenements according to law.
2. On receipt of the application dated November 21, 1945, the respondent wrote to the first petitioner on December 6, 1945, requesting him to see him on any working day with all relevant documents, as he would inquire into the charges being made as rents for the shops in the said building. The first petitioner did not appear before the respondent by December 31, 1945, and the respondent wrote to him inter alia on the said date intimating to him that as he had not complied with his request to see him in the matter of the charges being made as rents for the shops in the said building, he, the respondent, proposed to fix the standard rents as noted therein and would do so unless definite information regarding the rent at which the premises were let in September, 1940, was produced by him before January 15, 1946.
3. The petitioners thereafter appeared before the respondent on or about April 3, 1946, when the application came up for hearing. Certain preliminary objections were then raised by the petitioners objecting to the jurisdiction of the respondent to determine the standard rent of the shop and also contending that the matters comprised in the application had been finally disposed of by the respondent on January 3, 1944. The preliminary objections were overruled by the respondent and the respondent continued proceedings to determine the standard rent of the shops. The hearing of the application was postponed from time to time and was finally fixed on June 28, 1946. In the meantime the petitioners filed this petition on June 27, 1946, and obtained a rule from my brother Chagla calling upon the respondent to show cause why a writ of certiorari or a writ of prohibition should not be issued against him or an order and injunction under Section 45 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, should not be issued against him.
4. In the petition filed by the petitioners, after setting out the facts hereinbefore set out by me as regards the purchase of the property by them and letting out of the shops to the various parties as also the proceedings before the respondent in about December, 1943, and what had happened on the hearing of the fresh application dated November 21, 1945, before the respondent, the petitioners submitted that the respondent had no jurisdiction to entertain the application inasmuch as admittedly the rent payable by the applicants did not exceed Rs. 80 per month. The petitioners contended that the provisions of the Bombay Rents, Hotel Rates and Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1944, hereinafter referred to as the Act under which alone the respondent had been given jurisdiction to determine the standard rent did not apply to the cases of the said Sakhavat Hussein, Messrs. Rameschandra & Co. and Messrs. Friendly Stores. They further submitted that as regards the applications made by Messrs. Khodadad R. Irani and Messrs. Friendly Stores the respondent had no jurisdiction to entertain the same as they had in December, 1943, made a similar application to the respondent for determination of the amount of the standard rent which the respondent had dismissed, that they had not proceeded in appeal against the 'decision of the respondent dismissing' the application and that the matter had therefore become final under the provisions of the Act, and there was no provision in law entitling the respondent to entertain a fresh application in respect of the same subject-matter. They therefore submitted that having regard to the law for the time being in force the respondent was barred from entertaining any application from the said persons and exercise jurisdiction over it. They further submitted that in so far as Tukaram Tavde was concerned there was an Additional ground that he was not a tenant at all but was merely a licensee in occupation of the premises by leave and license of the petitioners and without any rent, that to such a person the provisions of the Act did not apply and the respondent had no jurisdiction to entertain any application for determination of any rent at the instance of Tukaram Tavde. Based on these averments and submissions the petitioners asked for various reliefs:
5. The respondent filed his affidavit dated July 25, 1946, wherein after raising certain preliminary objections he proceeded to state that during the proceedings before him he gathered that the whole premises, parts of which were now occupied by the applicants, were originally let to one S.B. Tata by the previous owners of the property, that S.B. Tata continued to be the tenant of the premises even after the petitioners purchased the property, such tenancy continuing up to February, 1942, and that the rent paid by S.B. Tata to the petitioners was Rs. 120 per month in respect of the premises. He proceeded to state that In the course of the hearing he understood that after S.B. Tata had vacated the premises the premises were divided into five compartments and one of these compartments was again divided into two parts, one part being occupied by Tukaram Tavde and the other part by the watchman of the petitioners, and that he intimated to the petitioners that he would fix the rents of the premises in question at the next hearing, viz. June 28, 1946, and adjourned the hearing in order to give to the petitioners an opportunity of producing any evidence in their possession as to the standard rent of the premises. As regards the previous application which had been made before him in December, 1943, he stated that he had no sufficient materials to show that the rent of the premises occupied by the then applicants exceeded Rs. 80 per month or that they were parts of larger premises occupied and let as a whole and subsequently sub-divided and that he therefore did not think that he was in a position to proceed with the applications and had therefore dismissed the same.
6. The first petitioner filed an affidavit in rejoinder on July 31, 1946, wherein, after reiterating his contentions and submissions contained in the petition, he stated that only one shop which is at present occupied by Khodadad R. Irani was let out to S.B. Tata, that S.B. Tata was the tenant, of the previous landlords in respect only of the said shop, but being an old servant of theirs was allowed to use the godown adjoining the said shop by leave and license and as a matter of favour. He stated that after S.B. Tata had vacated the premises the same were divided into five compartments, that the shop let out to S.B. Tata had always been in the same condition as before but that the godown adjoining the said shop was divided by the petitioners in four compartments. He submitted that the respondent had no jurisdiction to determine the question as to whether the premises were let out as a whole and then let out in parts as now sought to be contended by the applicants occupying the various parts of the premises.
7. When the petition came on for hearing before me the Advocate General for the respondent urged several preliminary objections. I shall first deal with two preliminary objections which, if valid, would go to show that the petition as framed is not maintainable. The Advocate General contended (1) that the petition disclosed no cause of action, and (2) that there was such suppression or non-statement of material facts as would vitiate the whole petition. In order to appreciate these contentions of the Advocate General, it is necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Act. Part II of the Act refers to ""Residential and other premises"" and by Section 3 of the Act it is laid down that the provisions of that part should apply to premises the standard rent of which) exceeds Rs. 80 per mensem in areas to which the Bombay Rent Restriction Act, 1939, was applicable. Section 4(4) of the Act defines what is ""standard rent"", and the standard rent in relation to any premises there is laid down as:
Section 13 lays down in what cases the Controller may fix the standard rent. Under the terms of that section the Controller is empowered to fix the standard rent at such amount having regard to the provisions of Part II of the Act and the circumstances of the case he deems just:
These are the relevant provisions of the Act necessary to be referred to in connection with these contentions of the Advocate General. The respondent would have jurisdiction to determine the standard rent of the premises only if the premises were first let after September 1, 1940, and the rent at which they were first let was in his opinion excessive, or where the premises were let at one time as a whole and at another time in parts, or the tenant had sub-let any part of the premises let to him., or any difficulty arose in giving effect to Part II of the Act for any other reason, or where the premises had been let furnished and it was necessary to distinguish for the purpose of giving effect to this part the amount payable as rent from the amount payable as hire for the furniture. These provisions, however, are controlled by Section 3 of the Act which lays down that the provisions of this part would apply to premises the standard rent of which exceeded Rs. 80 per mensem. If the standard rent of the premises did not exceed Rs. 80 per mensem, Section 13 of the Act would not invest the respondent with any jurisdiction to fix the standard rent of the premises. The premises which have got to be considered in this connection are the premises as they were let on September 1, 1940, or before September 1, 1940, in those cases where they had been let in fact on or before September 1, 1940, or the premises as they were first let after September 1, 1940. It may be that in those eases where the premises were first let after September 1, 1940, the rent at which they were first let was in the opinion of the Controller excessive. he would then be entitled tinder Section 13(a) of the Act to fix the standard rent of those premises. The premises might be let at one time as a whole and at another time in parts, or the tenant might sub-let a part of the premises let to him. Even in those cases the premises would be those which have been let as a whole or let to the tenant and the Controller would then, by reason of the circumstances mentioned in Section 13(6) of the Act, Viz. the premises at one time having been let out in parts or a tenant having' sub-let a part of the premises let to him, be entitled: to determine the standard rent of the smaller premises thus let out either by the landlord to the tenant or by the tenant to the sub-tenant. In the case of these premises, however, it would appear that the premises the standard rent of which would have to be taken into consideration by the Controller would be the larger premises and the Controller would be entitled to determine the standard rent of the smaller premises Jet out by the landlord to the tenant or by the tenant to the sub-tenant with reference to the same, the standard rent of the larger premises being the rent thereof as laid down in Section 4(4) (a), (b) and (c) of the Act. In all these cases, the respondent would have jurisdiction to determine the standard rent of the premises only if the standard rent exceed Rs. 80 per month, that being the condition of the applicability of Part II of the Act as laid down in Section 3 thereof. Based on these sections, therefore, the preliminary objections which the Advocate General urged were that it was necessary for the petitioner in his petition to state what was the position of the premises, whether they were let on September 1, 1940, whether, if not so, they were let before September 1, 1940, or they were let first after September 1, 1940, and what were the standard rents of the premises before he could submit that the respondent had no jurisdiction to entertain the application dated November 21, 1945. The petitioners did not state any of these necessary facts, but only stated in paragraph 11 of their petition:
8. Mr. Banaji for the petitioners recognised the force of these contentions of the Advocate General and the only thing which he could say in defence of what the petitioners had done was that though not expressly but by necessary implication the position could only be that the standard rent of the premises was less than Us. 80 per month. He submitted that the applicants who were admittedly paying rents at the rate of Us. 80, Rs. 35, Rs. 80 and Rs. 80 (except Khodadad R. Irani who was paying Rs. 115 per month) could never have gone to the respondent to fix the standard rent of the premises respectively in. their occupation unless and until their contention was that the standard rents of the premises were less than Rs, 80 per month. He therefore submitted that admittedly the standard rents of the premises were less than Rs. 80 even though it was not so expressly stated by the petitioners in their petition. He further submitted that even though the Court came to the conclusion that there was a defect in the petition in so far as these facts were not stated by the petitioners therein, the omission to state those facts was not intentional or with a view to mislead or deceive the Court but was merely accidental and unintentional. He therefore applied for leave to amend the petition in terms of the draft Ex. A by stating that the standard rent of the premises in the occupation of each of the four occupants Sakhavat Hussein, Messrs. Friendly Stores, Rameshchandra & Co. and Tukaram Tavde was less than Rs. 80 per month. The Advocate General opposed this application of Mr. Banaji. He contended that the petition was bad as it stood and was liable to be dismissed and the only effect of the Court granting the amendment would be to put a fresh petition on file with the proper averments contained therein. He therefore submitted that if the Court was inclined to grant the amendment applied for by Mr. Banaji, it should be on terms that all the costs of the petition up to the date of the application for amendment should be ordered to be paid by the petitioners to the respondent.
9. On a reading of the relevant sections of the Act hereinbefore set out, I am of opinion that the facts which I have mentioned above were material facts which required to be stated by the petitioners in the petition before they could base any contentions or submissions thereon and before they would be entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for by them in their petition. In the absence of those material facts the petition was defective and the preliminary objection urged by the Advocate General that the petition discloses no cause of action was a good one. It was essential for the petitioners to state in their petition what was the position of the premises on September 1, 1940, whether they were let out on September 1, 1940, whether, if not so, they were let out before September 1, 1940, or were first let out after September 1, 1940, and what was the standard rent of the premises within the meaning of the definition thereof in Section 4(4) of the Act. It was not sufficient merely to state that the rent payable by the applicants was below Its. 80 per month. That averment kept open the question as to what were the premises of which the standard rent had got to be taken into consideration by the respondent and what was the standard rent of those premises. In the absence of the necessary averments in this behalf, the petition was certainly defective. The amendment which was applied for by Mr. Banaji did seek to cure that defect to a certain extent, in so far as it stated that the standard rent of the premises in the occupation of each of the said applicants was less than Rs. 80 per month. Even though this amendment did not go as far as it should in the matter of stating the other material facts which 1 have mentioned above, no further objection was urged by the Advocate General as regards the petition as amended not disclosing a cause of action, and even though I would have been inclined to entertain such an objection if taken by the Advocate General, I do not think it under the circumstances necessary to entertain such objection any further, Mr. Banaji did not dispute the proposition laid down in Rex v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners, but drew my attention to a passage from the judgment of Low J. therein at p. 498, where the learned Judge observed that ""the statements made in the affidavit on which the rule nisi was granted were very far from being honest and candid."" He submitted that whatever may be said of the petitioners in this petition, it could not be said that the suppression or non-statement of material facts was the result of any deliberate intention on their part to mislead or deceive the Court or that their attitude was ""not honest and candid."" I accept that position which was submitted before me by Mr. Banaji. I do not think that the suppression or the non-statement of material facts in the petition was due to any intention on the part of the petitioners to mislead or deceive the Court. It was a result of inadvertence or want of appreciation of the true legal position on the part of their legal advisers, and under the circumstances I am not inclined to inflict on the petitioners the dire consequences which are laid down in the judgment of the Appeal Court in Rex v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners. I, therefore, grant the amendment which has been applied for by Mr. Banaji. In so far, however, as I am of opinion that the petition but for the amendment is defective and is liable to be dismissed, I would allow the amendment on terms that the petitioners do pay to the respondent the costs of the petition incurred up to November 13, 1940, which is the date on which the application for amendment was made by Mr. Banaji.
10. The further preliminary objection which was taken by the Advocate General was that the Act provides an appeal from the decision of the respondent, that an adequate remedy therefore exists and that the Court should not grant any writ of certiorari to the petitioners. In my opinion this can hardly be stated to be a preliminary objection. It is an objection on the merits. It amounts to this that even though all the facts which are mentioned in the petition be treated as correct, the Court should not grant a writ of certiorari as prayed for by the petitioners because an adequate remedy being available to the petitioners there is no case for the grant of a writ of certiorari. It may, however, be treated as a demurrer, a sort of preliminary Objection which can be urged by the respondent and I shall deal with it as such. In support of this objection of his the Advocate General relied upon the provisions of Section 14 of the Act which provides that:
He submitted that a right of appeal to the Collector was provided against the decision of the respondent, that in the case of an adverse decision being reached by the respondent the petitioners were entitled under the provisions of this section to file an appeal before the Collector, and that that was an adequate remedy provided by the Act itself to the petitioners. In this connection he drew my attention to a decision of the Madras High Court in Ranganathan v. Krishnayya [1946] A.I.R. Mad. 504, where it is laid down (p. 506) :
11. An obiter of the Appeal Court, even though I would attach considerable weight to the same, is not necessarily binding on me, and if the circumstances of the case warranted the same, I would have certainly reviewed the cases all on my own and have come to a definite conclusion one way or the other on this aspect of the case. In so far however as the petitioners have not made any allegations in their petition that the respondent has acted in any way contrary to the fundamental principles of justice, I refrain from considering this aspect of the case in any detail and will content myself with observing that I leave the point open for decision if any future occasion arises. I must, however, observe that even though at one time the opinion was held that although the writ is not of course it will nevertheless be granted ex debito justitice to quash proceedings which the Court has power to quash, where it is shown that the Court below has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, if the application is made by an aggrieved party and not merely by one of the public (vide Halsbury's Laws of England, Hailsham Edition, Vol. IX, page 878, Article 1481), the trend of authorities recently has been to hold that the fact of there being a remedy by way of an appeal is no answer to a writ of prohibition where the want of jurisdiction complained of is based upon the breach of fundamental principles of justice. There is plenty of authority for the proposition that in such cases prohibition will lie notwithstanding that there is a right of appeal. This latter proposition is based on the case of Rex v. North: Oakey, Ex parte [1927] 1 K.B. 491. To the same effect are also the observations in Note (r) at page 822 of Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. IX, where it is stated :
12. There is no doubt that apart from the trend of recent authorities the position in law as it was conceived at one time was that the writ could be issued to quash proceedings where it was shown that the Court below had acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, irrespective of the fact whether there was a remedy by way of appeal available to the petitioner. As I have already stated, that point is, so far as our Court is concerned, not finally decided. Even if that were the true position in law contrary to the obiter of the Appeal Court in Khurshed Mody v. Rent Controller, Bombay, the petitioners would not necessarily be out of Court. The right of appeal which is granted under Section 14 of the Act is available only in those cases where Part II of the Act applies. If by virtue of the operation of Section 8 of the Act Part II of the Act did not come into operation at all, there will be no question of the right of appeal being available to the petitioners, Part II of the Act not applying at all, the provision for appeal made in Section 14 of the Act would not be of any avail to the petitioners nor could it be trotted out against the petitioners as disentitling them to a writ of certiorari or prohibition as the case may be. This to my mind is the real answer to this objection of the Advocate General. No doubt if I accept the obiter of the Appeal Court in Khurshed Mody v. Rent Controller, Bombay, there being no allegation that the respondent has acted in a manner contrary to the fundamental principles of justice, the right of appeal which is provided in Section 14 of the Act would come in their way. Even, here the existence of the right of appeal being conditional on Part II of the Act applying to the facts of this particular case, the petitioners would be entitled to submit that there being no right of appeal there was no question of the writ of certiorari or prohibition as the ease may be not being granted to them even in the absence of any averment that the respondent had acted in a manner contrary to the fundamental principles of justice. This, in my opinion, would be an answer to the preliminary objection of the Advocate General on either point of view, whether the position in law as laid down in the passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, Hailsham Edition, Vol. IX, p. 822, cited above and adopted by Kania J. was correct or the position as adopted in the obiter by the Appeal Court in Khurshed Mody v. Rent Controller, Bombay, was correct. This objection of the Advocate General therefore fails.
13. A further preliminary objection was taken by the Advocate General that the Court should not interfere by certiorari in matters which the Court itself would have no jurisdiction to try. He relied in this connection on a passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, Hailsham Edn., Vol. IX, p. 854, § 1446 :
14. It was also held by me in that case (p. 1088) :
15. I shall now proceed to discuss the position on the merits of the petition. As I have already stated the applicants sent their application to the respondent on November 21, 1945, in which they contended that the shop galas Nos. 10, 11, 12, 18 and 14 which they were occupying formed one single tenement in September 1040, that the rent charged for that single tenement which was let to S.B. Tata was Its. 120 per month which was the standard rent of the said tenement, that the landlords, with a view to circumvent the provisions of the law, got the tenement divided by temporary (katcha) wooden partitions into five tenements conveniently and had been charging Rs. 80, Rs. 35, Rs. 80, Rs. 80 and Rs. 115 respectively for the same. This was their complaint. Their contention therefore came to this that there were certain premises which were let at one time as a whole and at another time in parts, that the standard rent of the larger premises which were let at one time as a whole was Rs. 120 per month, that the said premises having been at another time let in parts, it was competent to the respondent to fix the standard rent of those smaller premises at such amount as having regard to the provisions of Part II of the Act and the circumstances of the case he deemed just. The application was thus an application within the purview of Section 13(b) of the Act. If these were the allegations in the application made before him, the larger premises were really premises of which the standard rent exceeded Rs. 80 per month, the standard rent according to the applicants having been Rs. 120 per month, viz. the rent at which they were let on September 1, 1940, to S.B. Tata. On these allegations I have no doubt that the respondent had jurisdiction to entertain the application. The terms of Section 13(b) were specifically brought into operation and the jurisdiction which is vested in the respondent under Section 13(6) of the Act was invoked. It was open to the petitioners then to appear before the respondent and urge what they had got to say in answer to the application. It was not an application in which all the individual applicants wanted to have the standard rent fixed in respect of certain premises which had been let out on September 1, 1940, or not having been so let out had been let out earlier than September 1, 1940. The petitioners have in fact admitted, apart from the contentions which they raised as regards the premises occupied by S.B. Tata on September 1, 1910, being the only premises occupied by him and having been the subject-matter of the rent bills which were issued by the former landlords as also by themselves to S.B. Tata, that the godown which was adjoining the shop which had been let out to S.B. Tata had been divided by them into compartments which were subsequently let out by them to the occupants of the shops Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13. Under these circumstances a question did arise for determination by the respondent whether the premises which were let out on September 1, 1940, were the premises which were at that time let out as a whole but were later on sub-divided and let out in parts or whether those were the premises which were the premises let ultimately to Khodadad R. Irani at a rental of Rs. 115 per month. It may be noted in passing that if the contentions of the petitioners in that behalf were correct, and S.B. Tata had been paying a sum of Rs. 120 per month for only those premises which are now occupied by Khodadad R. Irani, the petitioners let out those premises to Khodadad R. Irani on September 1, 1943, at a rental of Rs. 115 per month. How the petitioners came to be charitable enough to reduce the standard rent of those premises from Rs. 120 per month to Rs. 115 per month is a mystery which it is not easy to solve in the absence of any materials placed before me in that behalf. If at all this circumstance points to anything, it points to this that the premises which were let to S.B. Tata could not have been occupied by Khodadad R. Irani and the premises which were let out to S.B. Tata by the previous landlords and by the petitioners thereafter must certainly have been larger in area-how much larger, again, is a mystery which it is not, in the absence of materials before me, easy to solve than the premises let out now to Khodadad R. Irani. If those were the circumstances, the operation of Section l'3(b) of the Act was certainly invited. The respondent had jurisdiction to determine the rent of the premises occupied by the applicants having particular regard to the standard rent of the premises as they had been let at one time as a whole to S.B. Tata at a rental of Rs. 120 per month which was the standard rent of those premises and it could not be contended that the respondent had no jurisdiction to entertain the application.
16. It was sought to be argued on behalf of the petitioners that the respondent had no jurisdiction to determine the question as to whether the premises were at one time let out as a whole and then let out in parts as was sought to be contended by the applicants. This contention reminds one of the contention which is usually urged in the matter of arbitrations, viz. that the arbitrators have no jurisdiction to determine the question as to the factum or the validity of the contract which contains the arbitration clause and thus to assume jurisdiction to arbitrate in the dispute between the parties by a decision arrived at by themselves. It is to be noted however that the arbitrators have no jurisdiction to entertain any disputes between the parties and to enter upon any reference unless there is a valid contract which has been entered into between the parties and which contains an arbitration clause. The factum and the validity of the contract are the essential conditions precedent to the arbitrators having any jurisdiction, and it is a well recognised principle of law that the arbitrators cannot assume jurisdiction unto themselves by adjudicating upon the factum or the validity of the contract where the same is disputed. The jurisdiction of the Rent Controller, on the other hand, is not a jurisdiction which rests merely upon any agreement between the parties. It is a statutory jurisdiction which is vested in the Rent Controller by the terms of the Act itself. A regular tribunal is established by the Act which functions in those cases where the standard rent of the premises as laid down in Section 8 of the Act exceeds Rs. 80 per month. The tribunal owes its existence to the Act and not to any act of the parties, and it has, therefore, jurisdiction to determine what are the cases which fall within its jurisdiction. If there is any dispute which arises between the parties as to whether the particular application falls within the jurisdiction of the tribunal, it is the tribunal which is competent to decide that dispute and determine whether the particular matter falls within its jurisdiction. If the tribunal decided it wrongly, there is an appeal provided against its decision. It cannot, therefore, be contended, as the petitioners have done, that the respondent has no jurisdiction to determine the question as to whether the premises were at one time let out as a whole and then let out in parts as contended by the. applicants.
17. Under the circumstances set out above I have come to the conclusion that the respondent had jurisdiction to entertain the application and to determine the various questions which were raised in that application. I, therefore, do not accept the contention of the petitioners that the respondent assumed to himself jurisdiction which in law he did not possess or was otherwise acting illegally and against the express provisions of law which it was incumbent upon him to follow.
18. The same is my conclusion as regards the other question which has been mooted by the petitioners, viz. that Tukaram Tavde is not their tenant at all but merely a licensee in occupation of the front part of shop No. 11 by leave and license of the petitioners and without any rent. The respondent would certainly have jurisdiction to determine whether Tukaram Tavde was a tenant or was a mere licensee of the petitioners, that question being also a question which would have to be determined by him within the ambit of Section 13(6) of the Act. It is not only in cases where the parties agree or it is admitted that the premises were at one time let out as a whole and were let out in parts at another time that the respondent would have jurisdiction to entertain the application. The respondent would have jurisdiction to entertain the application where that was the allegation in the application and had to be determined by him, having regard to the provisions of Part II of the Act. To hold otherwise would be to put a premium on dishonesty. It would merely suffice in that event for the landlord to dispute that the premises were at one time let out as a whole and at another time let out in parts or to dispute that the applicants were the tenants of his and thus oust the jurisdiction of the Rent Controller which otherwise he would have under Section 13(b) of the Act.
19. There remains only one further point to be determined and it is that the respondent having already dismissed the applications of Khodadad R. Irani and Messrs. Friendly Stores on January 3, 1944, and no appeal having been filed by them against the said decision, the respondent was not entitled to entertain a fresh application in respect of the same subject-matter, and that having regard to the law for the time being in force, he was barred from entertaining any application on behalf of the applicants and exercise jurisdiction over the same. This is in effect a plea of res judicata. No doubt the principles of res judicata as such have no application to the facts of this case. But the Court would certainly be guided by principles analogous to res judicata in matters of this type. If the respondent had in fact after going into all the matters and evidence before him come to the conclusion in that earlier application of the applicants Khodadad R. Irani and Messrs. Friendly Stores that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the applications of those parties, it would certainly not be open to the respondent to go into the same matter over again. The Court should not countenance any harrassment of the parties at the instance of litigants who would flood the tribunal with applications one after the other, even though the tribunal had pronounced adversely to them. The facts of this case, however, do not warrant any such position. The respondent has definitely stated in para. 12 of his affidavit that at that time he had no sufficient materials to show that the rent, meaning thereby the standard rent, of the premises occupied by the then applicants exceeded Rs. 80 per month or that they were parts of the larger premises occupied and let as a whole and subsequently sub-divided, and therefore did not think that he was in a position to proceed with the said applications. This was an attitude perfectly in consonance with law. The respondent would have had no jurisdiction unless the facts were either alleged or proved that the premises were let out at one time as a whole and were let out at another time in parts or that the standard rent of the premises, meaning thereby larger premises in the sense which I have referred to before, exceeded Rs. 80 per month. The respondent did not go into the merits of that application at all at that time and declined to go into the same in the absence of any materials furnished to him which would enable him to come to any conclusion one way or the other on that application. The application therefore can be stated to have been dismissed not on the merits but by default and that certainly cannot be res judicata even though the principles of res judicata which are enunciated in Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code be strictly applied to the facts of the case. There is also a further difficulty which the petitioners have to face in this behalf. A point as to res judicata is one which does not go to the root of jurisdiction. The tribunal may have and can have jurisdiction to determine the disputes between the parties. Nonetheless it may be barred from entertaining certain points of dispute or issues between the parties as being barred by res judicata. Whether the particular point in dispute or issue is res judicata or not lies to be determined by the tribunal itself. A wrong decision by the tribunal as to a certain point of dispute or issue being res judicata does not oust the jurisdiction of the tribunal. It only amounts to a wrong decision on a point which falls to be determined by the tribunal itself. A tribunal which has jurisdiction to decide a particular matter is entitled to decide it rightly or wrongly, and if it decides it wrongly, the proper remedy is to file an appeal against the decision of the tribunal. The remedy is by way of an appeal against that decision and not by way of challenging the jurisdiction of the tribunal itself. This, in my opinion, is the correct position as regards this point of res judicata which has been urged by the petitioners. As I have already held, the respondent had jurisdiction to entertain this application, and whether the particular dispute or issue between the parties or some of them was res judicata or not fell to be determined by the respondent himself. If he decided the point wrongly, Section 14 of the Act provided an appeal against the decision of the respondent, and it was open, after the whole case was over, to the petitioners to have filed an appeal to the Collector against that decision of the respondent. It was certainly not competent to the petitioners to urge, as they have done before me, that a wrong decision on the point of res judicata, even if it could be conclusively demonstrated before me to be a wrong decision could ever oust the jurisdiction of the respondent. In my opinion, therefore, this contention of the petitioners also fails.
20. Under the circumstances mentioned above, I am of opinion that the petition is entirely misconceived, that the contentions of the petitioners that the respondent assumed to himself jurisdiction which in law he did not possess and was otherwise acting illegally and against the express provisions of law which it was incumbent upon him to follow are absolutely unsound, and the petition is liable to be dismissed. I accordingly dismiss the petition with costs, The rule will be discharged.

(1) The plaintiff was appointed an additional Judge of tile High Court at Calcutta on February Ii, 1949 and a permanent Judge of the said court on 21st January, 1950. He gave his date of birth as 27th December, 1904. After the plaintiff had been in office for about ten years the Home Minister, Government of India purported to reopen the question of his age on the ground of discrepency between the age as stated in his certificate for the Matriculate Examination and the age given by him. The Government of India held the plaintiff's correct date of birth to be 27th December, 1901. This determination opened the gates of the litigation between the plaintiff and the Government. The plaintiff filed petition in the circuit bench of the Punjab High Court but it was dismissed as not maintainable. The plaintiff then filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court at Calcutta. It was heard by a Special Bench of five judges and his petition was dismissed by a majority decision of four judges vide judgment dated 22nd May, 1964. The plaintiff filed an appeal to the Supreme Court by special leave which was allowed on 9th November, 1964 and this judgment is . The Supreme Court held that the purported decision of the Government of India determining the plaintiff's date of birth as 27th December, 1901 was no decision of the President within the meaning of article 217(3) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court while deciding the plaintiff's appeal gave certain directions. Persuant to these directions the Home Ministry on or about 17th November, 1964 made a reference to the President of India inviting him to decide the question of plaintiff's age under Article 217(3) of the Constitution. The President consulted the Chief Justice of India who on 28th September, 1965 advised him to hold that the plaintiff was born on 27th December, 1901 and not on 27th December, 1904. The President of India on 29th September, 1965 passed the following order :    ""Iaccept the advice tendered by the Chief Justice of India and decide that the age of Sri Jyoti Prakash Mitter should be determined on the basis that he was born on 27th December, 1901.""  
(2) The plaintiff by his letter dated 15th October, 1965 to the President prayed that his decision should be reopened and that he should be granted an audience in the presence of the Chief Justice of India and a representative of the Home Ministry. The plaintiff was told by the Home Ministry that the matter could not be reopened. The plaintiff on 3rd August, 1966 then moved the Calcutta High Court again under article 226 of the Constitution of India praying inter alia that the purported decision of the President of India be set aside or quashed or for other appropriate reliefs. The rule nisi issued on the said writ petition was made absolute by O. D. Basu, J. of the Calcutta High Court vide judgment dated 7th and 8th August, 1967. It was held that the order dated 29th September, 1965 of the President of India was not a decision of the President in terms of article 217(3) of the Constitution. The learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court, after the delivery of the judgment on a verbal prayer for a Certificate under article 132(1) of the Constitution on the ground that the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of Article 217(3) of the Constitution, granted the certificate asked for. The defendant, Union of India filed the petition of appeal in the Supreme Court and reiterated that the appeal involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of Article 217(3) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court accepted the appeal of the defendant and reversed the judgment of the Calcutta High Court. The Supreme Court Judgment : Union of India vs. Jyoti Prakash Mitter is . The plaintiff filed an application before the Supreme Court for review of judgment dated 21st January, 1971 but his application was dismissed in liming. The plaintiff served a notice dated 10-1-1974 under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure upon the defendant and filed the present suit on 19th March, 1974 for a declaration that the judgment of the Supreme Court of India pronounced on 21st January, 1971 in Civil Appeal No. 52 of 1968 is without jurisdiction and nullity and not binding on him and that he is entitled to claim the status of a High Court Judge till 27th December, 1966.
(3) The defendant in the written statement dated 24th July, 1975 pleads that (i) Suit is not maintainable in as much is the plaintiff is seeking a declaration of the judgment of the Supreme Court of India pronounced on 21st January, 1971 to be without jurisdiction and nullity; (ii) The suit is barred by limitation; (iii) The suit for mere declaration without consequential relief is not maintainable as required by section 34 of the Specific Relief Act; (iv) Even assuming the age of the plaintiff to be as claimed by him he cannot now be declared to be continuing as a Judge of Calcutta High Court as he has according to date of birth claimed by him, crossed the date of retirement and that the declaration sought for by the plaintiff even if granted would be futile and as such the suit is not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed on this ground. On merits it is stated by the defendant that the plaintiff was appointed as an Additional Judge of the High Court of Calcutta on 11th January, 1949 and a permanent Judge on 23rd January, 1950, that no document in support of his age was submitted by him, that the defendant in 1956 collected particulars with regard to educational qualifications, age etc. in order to compile information about High Court Judges, and the plaintiff disclosed Ins date of birth as 27th December, 1904, that in February, 1959 the defendant received information that the correct date of birth the plaintiff was 27th December, 1901 which was confirmed by the defendant from the Bihar and Orissa Gazette dated 26th June. 1918 containing the results of the Matriculation Examination of Patna University held during April, 1918. The written statement further pleads that on 17th November, 1964 in pursuance of the directions of the Supreme Court in its judgment dated 9th November, 1964 the matter was placed again before the President of India for decision on plaintiff's age under Article 217(3) of the Constitution of India, that the President decided the question strictly in accordance with the said article 217(3) of the Constitution and it is not open to the plaintiff, in the present suit, to challenge the validity of the decision of the President, that the question regarding decision of the President is beyond the scope of relief sought in the suit. The defendant denies that the President had not applied his mind while arriving at a decision and that after seeking the advice of the Chief Justice of India as required under Article 217(3) of the Constitution, the President decided on 29th September, 1965 that the age of the plaintiff should be determined on the basis of 27th December, 1901 as his date of birth, that the judgment dated 21st January, 1971 delivered by the Supreme Court is perfect, legal and valid. It is also denied by the defendant that the judgment of the Supreme Court is without jurisdiction or nullity. The receipt of notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not denied but its validity is denied on the ground that it does not confirm to the requirements of section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The jurisdiction of this court to interfere with the judicial Judgment dated 21st January, 1971 of the Supreme Court is also denied by the defendant.   
(4) On the pleadings of the parties the following issues were framed on 8th October, 1976 :    (1)Whether the suit as framed is maintainable ? (2) Whether the suit is within time ? (3) Whether the judgment of the Supreme Court in C.A. 52 (N.C.M.) of 1968 dated 21st January, 1971 is without jurisdiction, a nullity and not binding on the plaintiff (This issue will cover the pleas raised by the plaintiff in paras 17, 18 and 19 of the plant) ? (4) Whether the notice served by the plaintiff on the defendants under section 80 Civil Procedure Code was not valid? (5) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim the status of a High Court Judge till 27th December, 1966 ? (6) Relief.  
(5) By the present suit the plaintiff seeks a declaration that the Judgment of the Supreme Court pronounced on 21st January, 1971 in his case is without jurisdiction and nullity and not binding upon him. Article 141 of the Constitution of India reads :    ""THElaw declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India.""  
Under the established principles as to judicial precedents the judgments of the highest court in the land are binding on all subordinate courts. This principle has been given constitutional recognition in this Article. A decision of the Supreme Court on a point of law in any dispute would have a binding effect not only on the parties to the suit but also on all courts in India as a precedent in which the law is declared by the Supreme Court. In the case of such a decision the enquiry whether it would operate as res-judicata in a subsequent case would be quite unnecessary even if the subsequent case is between the 376 same parties (See Amalgamated Coalfields Ltd. and another Vs. Janapada Sabha Chhindwara and others, . Not only this, the Supreme Court in Ballabhdas Mathuradas Lakbani and others Vs. Municipal Committee, Malkapur  observed that its judgment would be binding on all Courts in India even though a new point which was not taken into consideration by the Supreme Court is raised in respect of the question which the Supreme Court has declared the law. The plaintiff's claim about his date of birth was decided by the Supreme Court on 21st January, 1971 which judgment is . Under Article 141 this judgment of the Supreme Court is binding on this court. In other words nobody can be allowed to take any exception to any judgment passed by the Supreme Court. Thus a suit to challenge the validity of a judgment of the Supreme Court is barred. Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads :    ""COURTSto try all civil suits unlaws barred.- The Courts shall (subject to the provisions herein contained) have Jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. Explanation I : A suit in which the right to property or to an office is contested is a suit of a civil nature notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on the decision of questions as to religious rites or ceremonies. Explanation Ii : For the purposes of this section, it is immaterial whether or not any fees are attached to the office referred to in Explanation I or whether or not such office is attached to a particular place.""  
(6) It is also a well-known principle of law that where there is a right there is a remedy. A litigant having a grievance of a civil nature hag a right to institute a suit in some court or other unless its cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred (Smt. Ganga .Bai Vs. Vijay Kumar and others . The present suit is for a declaration that the judgment of the Supreme Court is without Jurisdiction and as under Article 141 of the Constitution the judgment of the Supereme Court is binding on all subordinate courts, the cognizance of present suit is barred under section 9 of the Code of Civil procedure. Ordinarily this court has jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature but as the suit challenging the law declared by the Supreme Court is barred under Article 141 of the Constitution, this court cannot take cognizance of the present suit. It is therefore, held that the present suit is not maintainable. Issue NO. 2   

(7) The judgment of the Supreme Court which is being challenged in the present suit was pronounced on 21st January, 1971. The suit was filed on 19th March, 1974. The present suit is against the Union of India and therefore under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure a notice has to be given. Notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure has been given by the plaintiff before the institution of the suit. Under section 15(2) of the Limitation Act, the period of two months prescribed for notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure is to be excluded for computing the period of limitation for the institution of the present suit. After excluding the period of notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure the suit has been filed within limitation. This issue is, therefore, decided against the defendant. Issue NO. 3   

(8) The Supreme Court judgment dated 21st January, 1971 between the parties is challenged by the plaintiff on the allegations contained in paras 17, 18 and 19 of the plaint which are as follow :    ""1.7.By the said judgment, the said High Court came to divers other important findings of fact in support of its final conclusion.""
(9) After the said judgment [in Civil Revision 1798(W) of 1966] had been delivered, holding that the impugned order of the President of India as to the question of plaintiff's age was not a 'decision' of the President in terms of Article 217(3) of the Constitution, learned Advocate for the Union of India made a verbal prayer for a certificate under Article 132(1) of the Constitution on the ground that the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of Article 217(3) of the Constitution. The certificate asked for was granted.
(10) By their Petition of Appeal in the Supreme Court, the Union of India reiterated that the appeal involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of Article 217(3) of the Constitution. No application under Article 136 of the Constitution was made on behalf of the Union of India and no Special Leave under Article 136 was given by the Supreme Court. Thus, the appeal to the Supreme Court by the Union of India was upon a certificate under Article 132(1) of the Constitution. No leave under Article 132(3) of the Constitution was asked for or obtained by the Union of India.   
(11) It is well-known that owing to his illness it was not possible for the plaintiff to appear before the Supreme Court at the final stage of the hearing of the appeal. His applications for an adjournment on the ground of his illness, which was of a grave nature, were dismissed offhand and on the fiction that he was then represented by an Advocate, and the Court (consisting of Shah, CJ., Sikri, Bhargava, Hegde, Grover and Dua, JJ.) delivered judgment on January 21, 1971, purporting to allow the Union of India's appeal by reversing all the material findings of fact arrived at by the High Court and grossly misstating vital facts as well as the contents of the High Court judgment, demonstrating that neither Shah, C.J., nor anyone of his colleagues had read through the judgment appealed from or that their reading of the judgment was so perfunctory as not to amount to a reading of the judgment at all.""   
(12) The plaintiff humbly submits that the appeal by the Union of India [Civil Appeal No. 52(NCM) of 1968] having been upon a certificate under Article 132(1) and no leave under Article 132(3) or Special Leave under Article 136 having been asked for and|or granted, the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to dispose of the appeal on grounds other than the ground on which the certificate Under Art. 132(1) had been granted and that in the absence of leave under Art. 132(3) or Special Leave under Article 136 of the Constitution, the findings of fact arrived at by the High Court could not be interfered with and set aside. In the premises, the said judgment of the Supreme Court was without jurisdiction and was accordingly a nullity, and so was the order which followed.""   
(13) The plaintiff further submits that as Article 217(3) of the Constitution had been interpreted by the Supreme Court in , the question as to the interpretation of Article 217(3) in relation to the appeal ceased to be a 'substantial question of law' as to the interpretation of the Constitution and that consequently the appeal filed by the Union of India on the basis of the said purported certificate was incompetent and not maintainable. That being the position, the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to entertain and/or hear the appeal.""   
(14) The writ petition filed by the plaintiff in the Calcutta High Court was decided on 7th and 8th August, 1967. The defendant made a verbal prayer for a certificate under Article 132(1) of the Constitution on the ground that the case involved a substantial question of law and the court granted the certificate asked for. Under Article 132(3) of the Constitution the defendant became entitled to file an appeal in the Supreme Court on the basis of the said certificate, to challenge that the question of law as to the interpretation of Article 217(3) of the Constitution was wrongly decided by he High Court. Article 132(3) further provides that the judgment of the High Court may be challenged on any other ground with the leave of the Supreme Court. The argument of the plaintiff is that the defendant before the Supreme Court never obtained any leave of the Supreme Court for challenging the judgment of the High Court on grounds other than the question of law as to the interpretation of Article 217(3) of the Constitution, that the defendant never made any separate petition staling the grounds to be raised and praying for leave to appeal on those grounds as required by Rule 5 of Chapter Xv of the Supreme Court Rules 1966. It is contended that as no leave was granted by the Supreme Court to the defendant to raise matters other than the question mentioned in the Certificate issued under Article 132(1) of the Constitution, the judgment dated 21st January, 1971 is without jurisdiction. Under Order 47 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966 the Supreme Court has inherent powers and also a power to dispense with its own rules. Rule 6 of Order 47 of the Supreme Court Rules may be referred. It reads :    ""NOTHINGin these rules shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent powers of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court.""  
(15) The Supreme Court in its judgment dated 21st January, 1971 has interpreted Article 217(3) of the Constitution and held that it was not obligatory on the President of India to give a personal hearing to the plaintiff before determining the question of his age. The further contention of the plaintiff is that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to dispose of the appeal on grounds other than the grounds on which the certificate under Article 131(1) of the Constitution had been granted and that the finding of fact arrived at by the High Court could not be interfered with and set aside by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court while interpreting Article 217(3) of the Constitution came to the conclusion that the decision of the President of India regarding the plaintiff's age was not open to challenge.   
(16) It was also argued that the appeal filed by the Union of India before the Supreme Court against the judgment of the High Court on the basis of the certificate granted under Article 132(1) of the Constitution was incompetent and not maintainable. It may be stated that after the judgment dated 21st January, 1971 by the Supreme Court the plaintiff filed a review petition before the Supreme Court but the same was dismissed. All the contentions that have been raised now in the present plaint specially those contained in paras 17, 18 and 19 of the plaint must be deemed to have been raised and rejected by the Supreme Court when his review petition was dismissed. Under Article 141 of the Constitution the judgment given by the. Supreme Court is binding on this court. It is not open to this Court to go into the various allegations challenging the judgment of the Supreme court. The issue is decided against the plaintiff. Issue NO. 4   

(17) The plaintiff served a notice dated 10th January, 1974 under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure before the Institution of the present suit. It appears to be in accordance with law. No validity was pointed out by the learned counsel for the defendant. The issue is therefore decided in favor of the plaintiff. Issue NO. 5   

(18) The Supreme Court in, its judgment dated 21st January, 1971 has not interfered with the judgment of the President of India holding the date of birth of the plaintiff as 27th December, 1901. Under Article 217(1) of the Constitution prior to its amendment by the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963 a High Court Judge was entitled to hold the office until he attained the age of 60 years. By the said Constitution (Fifteenth. Amendment) Act, 1963 it was provided that a High Court Judge would be entitled to hold office until he attained the age of 62 years. The data of birth of the plaintiff as determined by the President of India is 27th December, 1901 and therefore, he was entitled to hold office as a High Court Judge up to 26th. December, 1961. The plaintiff is therefore, not entitled to claim the status of a High Court Judge till 27th December. 1966 and this issue is decided against the plaintiff. Issue NO. 6   

(19) In view of my discussion on issues No. 1, 3 and 5 the plaintiff's suit is dismissed but with no order as to costs.

(1) This appeal has been filed under section 75 of the Provincial Insolvency Act against the appellate order of Mr. H. K. S. Malik, Additional District Judge, Delhi dated 8th October, 1974, by which he has dismissed the appeal of the appellant herein as barred by time. The appellant in the appeal before me is the insolvent who had been adjudicated by order dated 30th September, 1967 and a first appeal against the same was dismissed on 31st July, 1969 and a revision against the same was dismissed by this court on 27th March, 1970 and a petition for special leave to appeal has also been dismissed by the Supreme Court with the result that the adjudication has become .final. The petitioning creditor moved an application against the insolvent for directions to produce the books of account. There is some dispute as to where the account books are. The contention of the insolvent has been that they had been handed over to a private receiver appointed by the Hindustani Mercantile Association, but this fact has been denied by the opposite party. The Insolvency Court had previously ordered issue of summons to the Hindustani Mercantile Association and the said receiver to produce the account books in dispute, but on the objection of the creditor, the learned Insolvency Judge by the impugned order dated 8th June, 1973 recalled the said order holding that he was of the view that it was not at all proved that the account books were in possession of the said Association or the receiver and that the insolvent was trying to throw the burden on the said association and its receiver and so the previous order was cancelled and the case was adjourned for further proceedings. Feeling aggrieved by this order, the insolvent filed an appeal before the Additional District Judge, which has been dismissed as barred by time.  
(2) The facts material for the instant appeal are that the Insolvency Judge passed the impugned order on 8th June, 1973. From 9th June to 8th July, 1973 the District Courts were closed for the long vacation. On the 9th July, 1973 the appellant applied for supply of a certified copy of the impugned order of the Insolvency Judge. The certified copy was ready on 3rd August, 1973 and was delivered to the insolvent on 4th August, 1973. He, however, filed the appeal before the District Court on 20th August, 1973 after a delay of another 15 days. In the lower appellate court an application was moved under section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') for condensation of delay. The main allegation in the application was that during the vacation of the court, the copying agency was closed and so the appellant could not apply for supply of the certified copy and he had, therefore, rightly applied for it on the reopening day. Moreover, the application had first to be routed through the court concerned since the application for certified copy related to a pending matter. The grounds on which the condensation was sought was that the period of vacation of the court from 9th June to 8th July, 1973 should be excluded as the time requisite for obtaining the certified copy and if the same were allowed then the appeal was within time. No explanation was, however, given for each days delay subsequent to 3rd August, 1973, when the copy was ready.  
(3) It was also alleged in the said application that the appellant bad not been informed of the pronouncement of the impugned order by the Insolvency Judge on 8th June, 1973 and he had come to know about it only on 9th July, 1973. This was denied by the respondent. The learned Additional District Judge by the order impugned in the instant appeal held that the Insolvency Judge had given a date for announcement of the order as 8th June, 1973 and had announced it on the said date and, therefore, the contention of the appellant that he had not come to know of the order till 9th July, 1973 was untenable. With regard to exclusion of the time, it was held that it was not clear whether the copying agency was actually closed, but assuming the same to be closed, he found that this time could not be excluded and the appellant had failed to explain each days delay at least from 4th August, 1973 till 20th August, 1973. The learned Judge, therefore, declined to extend the time under section 5 and dismissed the appeal as barred by time with costs.  
(4) Mr. Bhardwaj appearing to support this appeal has contended that the period of vacation of the court (which commenced immediately after the pronouncement of the judgment, viz. 9th June to 8th July, 1973) was the time requisite for the appellant to obtain the certified copy of the order of the Insolvency Judge and the same must be excluded under section 12 of the Act. His second contention is that the lower appellate court ought to have condoned the delay in the circumstances of the case.  
(5) I have heard the counsel for the parties. In this appeal I am, however, not deciding the point whether against the order of the lower appellate court a revision or a second appeal under section 75 of the Provincial Insolvency Act is competent, since no such objection has been raised by the respondent. Mr. Bhardwaj in support of his contention has relied upon an impressive number of authorities. They are: Pikesar Nath Tewari v. Janakdeo Nath TewarL Air 1934 Patna 4(1), (which has followed Debi Charan Lal v. Mehdi Hussain, Air 1916 Patna 317(2), and Mushi Mahaton v. Lachman Lal, Air 1929 Patna 615 (3), Lalta Prasad v. Shyammohan Laxminarayan, , Kashibai v. Kannoo, Air 1915 Nagpur 117(5), Amar Chand v. Bach Raj, , Abdul Ghaffor v. Mt. Rasulunnis, Air 1922 Oudh 39(7), and Sri Chandan Bhuva v. Haroo Sethi, 11 Ind. Cases 387(8). The learned counsel has submitted that a contrary view has been taken by the High Court of Madras in Subramanyan v. Naraimhan. Air 1920 Madras 359(9), and the High Court of Allahabad in Puttu Lal v. Bhagwan Dass, . He has further submitted that a liberal construction should be placed on the provisions of section 12 of the Limitation Act so as to advance justice and to hold the appeal to be within time rather than shut out the appellant from the court.
(6) The reasoning adopted in the decisions relied upon by Mr. Bhardwaj is that during the period of vacation, the appellant could not apply for supply of certified copy for circumstances beyond his control and so the period of vacation is to be reckoned in the time properly required for obtaining the certified copy and the same would constitute the time requisite within the meaning of section 12(2) of the Act.  
(7) With utmost reluctance and with greatest respect which I owe to the weight of the authorities cited on behalf of the appellant, I find myself unable to agree with them. Section 12 occurs in Part Iii of the Act dealing with computation of period of limitation. Subsection (1) provides that the day from which such period is to be reckoned shall be excluded. Sub-section (2) reads as follows : ""(2) In computing the period of limitation for an appeal or an application for leave to appeal or for revision or for review of a judgment, the day on which the judgment complained of was pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the decree, sentence or order appealed from or sought to be revised or reviewed shall be excluded."" Explanation to this section reads as follows: ""In computing under this section the time requisite for obtraining a copy of a decree or an order, any time taken by the Court to prepare the decree or order before an application for a copy thereof is made shall not be excluded."" The expression ""time requisite"" has been considered by the Privy Council in Pramatha Nath Roy v. William Arthur Lee, Air 1922 PC352(11), and Jijibhoy N. Surty v. T. S. Chettyar, Air 1928 Pc 103(12), and that Judicial Committee has held that it meant the time properly and reasonably required and that the word 'requisite' was a strong word and it might be regarded as meaning something more than the word required ; it meant 'properly required' and it threw upon the pleader or counsel for the appellant the necessity of showing that no part of the delay beyond the prescribed period was due to his default. In my opinion, this has reference only to the time that is to begin on and after the making of the application for supply of certified copy until it is obtained and it does not have any reference to the passage of time prior to the moving of the application for copy. In Bechi v. Ahsan-Ullah Khan Air 12 Allahabad 461(13), a. Full Bench of the High Court held that time requisite for obtaining copy did not begin to run until the application had been made. This authority has been largely followed. The explanation to section 12 inserted in the Act of 1963 makes the legal position perfectly clear and it is a legislative recognition of the rule that the time consumed even by the court in preparing the decree or order before the application for its copy is made is not to be excluded as time requisite under section 12 of the Act.  
(8) In Jagat Dhish Bhargava v. Jawahar Lal Bhargava, , the Supereme Court was faced with the construction of the expression 'time requisite' and the maintainability of the appeal, where the court of first instance had not prepared the decree. The Supreme Court observed in paragraph 9 of the report as follows : ""Where a decree is not drawn up immediately or soon after a judgment is pronounced, two types of cases may arise. A litigant feeling aggrieved by the decision may apply for the certified copy of the judgment and decree before the decree is drawn up, or he may apply for the said decree after it is drawn up. In the former case, where the litigant, has done all that he could and has made a proper application for obtaining the necessary copies, the time requisite for obtaining the copies must necessarily include not only the time taken for the actual supply of the certified copy of the decree but also for the drawing up of the decree itself. In other words, the time taken by the office or the Court in drawing up a decree after a litigant has applied for its certified copy on judgment being pronounced, would be treated as a part of the time taken for obtaining the certified copy of the said decree.""
(9) With regard to the second case where an application for certified copy has been made after the decree, the Supreme Court noticed in paragraph 10 of the report that there was sharp difference of opinion amongst the High Courts ; Bombay, Calcutta and Patna High Courts had taken the view that the said period would constitute a part of the requisite period, while the other High Courts had taken a contrary view. Although the conflict was noticed, the Supreme Court found that it was not necessary to resolve the same in the case in its hand. The conflict in my opinion, appears to have been resolved by the insertion of the explanation to section 12. Now the time occurring before the making of the application cannot possibly constitute as time requisite under section 12. In sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the Act, the expression occurring is exclusion of time. Suppose the period of limitation for filing an appeal is 30 days and a time of 20 days is spent in obtaining the certified copy, then the party will have, in fact, 50 days time to file the appeal and the period of limitation is actually extended. This is not true of the vacation which does not have the effect of extending the period of limitation, but only allows an act to be performed an reopening after the vacation. Section 4 of the Limitation Act prescribes that where the prescribed period... expires on a day when the court is closed, (the matter) may be instituted on the day when the court reopens. Section 10 of the General Clauses Act also makes a provision enabling the parties to take steps which they are required to take during the prescribed period on the reopening of the court and office in case the last date of the period expired when the court or office was closed. The Supreme Court in (H. H. Raja) Harinder Singh v. Karnail Singh, , held that this was an enabling provision to enable the parties not to suffer for an act of the court and to do a thing which the law requires it to be done within a prescribed time when it is really possible to do on the reopening of the court. Therefore, in my opinion, neither section 4 of the Limitation Act nor section 10 of the General Clauses Act has the effect of extending the period of limitation. It is only an enabling provision which entitles the party to do on the reopening of the court what it was required to do at a time when the court was in vacation. For example, the period of limitation for filing an appeal expires on 30th June and the court be on vacation till 14th July, then if the appeal were filed on 15th July on the reopening day, it would be in time according to section 4 of the Act; Supposing it were filed on 16th July, then the delay in filing the appeal will be not only of one day but will consist of 15 days. The reason is that period of vacation is unlike provision in Chapter Iii of the Act not excluded from the period of limitation, but it only enables the party to tide over the period of vacation and perform the requisite act on the reopening day of the court.
(10) The High Courts which have taken the view to include, the vacation during the requisite period have recognised the force of Bechi v. Ahsan-Ullah Khan (supra) to the effect that time requisite for obtaining a copy did not begin to run until the application had been made. But they have carved out an exception to the said general rule on the ground that during the period of vacation, the party could not move the application. In my opinion, there is no scope for engrafting any exceptions to the rules under the Act on the basis of any analogy, hardship or necessary implication. The Limitation Act is an amending and consolidated Act and provides for all the contingencies it deals. An interesting instance occurs in setcion 15 of the Act. This provision deals with exclusion of the period of limitation during the period institution of any suit or execution of a decree has been stayed by injunction or order. This had reference to the orders of the court but the principles underlying the said provision had been extended by the High Courts to various situations where it was impossible for the party to institute the suit or application for execution, particularly when the same had been stayed by the statute (see Managing Committee Sunder Singri Malha Sirigh Rajput High School Indaura v. Sunder Singh Malha S:ngh Sanatan Dharam Rajput High School Trust, Air 1944 Lahore 190) (16). The Supreme Court in A.S.K Krishnappa Chettiar v. S.V.V. Soiah, Air 1964 Sc 277(17), strongly set its foot on the extension of the said principles. The court observed in paragraph 13 of the report that the Limitation Act was a consolidating and amending statute relating to the limitation of suits, appeals and certain types of applications to the court and it is a piece of adjective or procedural law and not of substantive law and it could be applied only to matters to which they were made applicable by the legislature expressly or by necessary implication. The court further observed that the provisions of sections 3 to 28 of the Act did not adumbrate any general principles of substantive law nor did they confer any substantive rights on litigants and, therefore, could not be permitted to have greater application than what was explicit or implicit in them and the suspension of limitation in circumstances of the kind obtaining in the appeals before the Supreme Court was neither explicit nor implicit and so contrary view of the High Courts, in particular Badruddin Khan v. Mahyar Khan, , and Managing Committee Sunder Singh Malha Singh Rajput High School (supra), was overruled.  
(11) In view of the said observations of the Supreme Court, it is impossible to accept the argument of the learned counsel based on the hardship of impracticability of applying for certified copy during the vacantion and the redy giving the benefit to the said period as a time requisite under section 12 of the Act. I may also mention that under section 12 of the Act, the party is as of right entitled to the exclusion of the time and it is not left to the discretion of the court whether or not be grant the same, but nothing that happens before the making of the application for certified copy (subsequent to the passing of the order) can really constitute time requisite under section 12 and the contention of the learned counsel must, therefore, fail and is rejected.  
(12) The last submission of the learned counsel is that the court below ought to have condoned the delay in the instant case. In my opinion, the only effect of the vacation was that application for copy filed on the reopening day of the court on 9th July, 1973 was in order and if he had filed the appeal on 4th August, 1973 as soon as he had obtained the copy, the appeal would have to be treated as filed in time. But he delayed its filing till 20th August, 1973. The court below has held that no explanation has been given for each day's delay. The learned counsel has failed to satisfy me that he has given any reasonable explanation. He has insisted upon his right and be was under the impression that the appeal was within time. This certainly does not constitute a sufficient ground for condensation of delay. Moreover, the matter rested in the discretion of the court below. It was held in Ram Lal v. Rewa Coalfields Ltd., , that after the appellant has explained each day's delay, the matter rested in the discretion of the court whether or not to condone the delay. The court below has refused to condone the delay and no ground has been made out for interfering with its order.

"Pawan Agrawal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 17 June, 2019",,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.       The petitioner Pawan Agrawal, has preferred this
petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C in connection with
Crime No.39/2017 under Section 307/34, 109, 112,
120-B,467,468 of IPC and 25, 27 of the Arms Act
registered at police station Lasudiya, District Indore for
quashment of FIR and all subsequent proceedings
taken thereunder.
2.     Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted
that the case of the present petitioner is identical to
the case of co-accused Hemant, whose petition under
section 482 of Cr.PC has been allowed by this Court
vide    order     dated     9.4.2019   passed    in    MCRC.
No.7823/2017 and FIR and all subsequent proceedings
have been quashed.
3.     The only difference is that as per statement of
Manish Yadav, co-accused Hemant had revealed before
him that after the incident he dropped the main
accused persons Umesh and Goldy at the house of
Pawan Agrawal and the present petitioner is same
                    2   MCRC No.21455/2019
Pawan Agrawal but nothing is recovered from his house
or no other evidence is produced by the police with the
charge sheet against him. Therefore, on the ground of
parity, he is also entitled for the same relief granted to
the co-accused Hemant.
4.   Learned public prosecutor has fairly admitted
parity of the case of the present petitioner with the
case of the co-accused Hemant.
5.   Order dated 9.4.2019 passed in the petition
preferred          by         co-accused              Hemant            in
MCRC.No.7823/2017 reads thus:-
accused persons.
5.      Contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is
that his name neither find place in Dehati Nalishi nor in the
dying declaration of the complainant. During the investigation,
the police arrested co-accused persons Kantilal and Anuj who
first revealed about the conspiracy hatched by the co-accused
persons but they also did not name the petitioner. After 10 days
of the incident, the police recorded statement of one Manish
Yadav under section 161 Cr.P.C., who first named the
petitioner as a person present in meeting convened in the house
of co-accused Umesh and where they discussed the plan to
eliminate Anchal but the same Manish Yadav did not name the
petitioner as a conspirator in his statement recorded under
section 164 of the Cr.P.C by the Judicial Magistrate First Class.
6.     It is further pointed out by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that even in his statement recorded under section 161
of the Cr.P.C, Manish Yadav did not name the petitioner as the
conspirator when they actually met to finalize the plan to
eliminate the complainant. No other evidence could be
collected by the police. The petitioner is impleaded on the false
pretext. He is facing trial since long. Even the charges have not
been framed till date, therefore, the proceedings against the
petitioner be quashed.
7.      Learned public prosecutor has opposed the prayer.
However, he fairly admitted the factual matrix of the case as
claimed by the learned counsel for the petitioner. Only
objection raised by the learned public prosecutor is that still 6
out of 13 co-accused persons namely Rahul, Dinesh, Sagar,
Satyanarayan, Shankar and Goldy are absconding from the
trial. There is an old rivalry between two groups, who are
indulged in attacks and counter attacks. Many other criminal
cases have been registered against the persons connected to
both the groups. This is a heinous crime, where the co-accused
persons hired a killer to eliminate a person with whom, they
were having some enmity. This is an increasing trend in the
society, therefore, such type of offence should be dealt
stringently and therefore, proceedings should not be dropped
against the petitioner.
8.      It is further argued that the petitioner can raise such
objections at the time of framing of the charges, therefore,
there is no need to quash the proceedings against him.
9. In the case of Vijayander Kumarb Vs. State of Rajasthan
reported in 2014(3) SCC 389, the guiding principles to be
followed while exercising powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
have been reiterated by the Hon'ble Supereme Court in the
following terms:
 Similar is the law noticed in the case of Dalip Kaur
      (supra). In this case the matter was remanded back to
      the High Court because of non-consideration of relevant
      issues as noticed in paragraph 10, but the law was
      further clarified in paragraph 11 by placing reliance
      upon judgment of this Court in R.Kalyani vs. Janak
      C.Mehta. It is relevant to extract paragraph 11 of the
      judgment which runs as follows :
10.     As admitted by the learned public prosecutor that factually
                                                     5   MCRC No.21455/2019
                                      it is correct that the petitioner is neither named in the Dehati
                                      Nalishi nor in the dying declaration of the complainant. Even he
                                      is not named as one of the conspirator by both the co-accused
                                      persons Kantilal and Anuj. Status of statement of Manish Yadav
                                      is also the same. He is also not named the petitioner as a
                                      conspirator, when actually the co-accused persons gathered to
                                      finalize the plan to eliminate the accused. He also dropped his
                                      name in his statement recorded by the Judicial Magistrate First
                                      Class u/S 164 Cr.P.C.
                                      11.     In such a situation, nothing remains against the petitioner
                                      to show his involvement either in the conspiracy or in the
                                      execution of the crime. If, the entire prosecution evidence as
                                      discussed above is accepted as it is or in toto, even then the
                                      conviction of the appellant cannot be procured. In such a
                                      situation, continuance of the prosecution of the petitioner is
                                      nothing but abuse of process of law. Therefore, the petition
                                      deserves to be and is allowed hereby.
                                      12. The prosecution against the petitioner pending before the
                                      Sessions Judge, Indore in Sessions Trial No.337/2017 is hereby
                                      set aside.
                                      13. The bail bond furnished by the petitioner stands
                                      discharged.""
                    6.                 Having regard to the parity with the co-accused
                    Hemant, the present petition is also allowed.
                    7.                 FIR No.0039 and all subsequent proceedings
                    taken thereunder qua the present petitioner Pawan
                    Agrawal S/o Madanlal Agrawal is hereby quashed.
                    His bail bond, if any, stands discharged.

"State vs Dhruba Charan Bahali on 28 July, 1975",,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.1. This is a proceeding initiated by this Court on its own motion under Section 15 of the- Contempt all Courts Act, 1971 (Act 70 of 1971) (hereinatfer referred to as the Act) read with Rule 2 (a) of the Rules made thereunder by the Orissa High Court against one Dhruba Charan Bahali the alleged contemner in the context of the admitted facts stated hereinafter.
2. Under annexure 1, the contemner, a resident of Rourkela addressed an undated petition to the Chief Justice of the Orissa High Court alleging that the local subordinate Judge Shri Satchidananda Das was busy in collecting illegal gratification; that on one occasion he brought the contemner under warrant and after snatching certain money from his pocket released him immediately. Therein it was further stated that the Subordinate Judge was harassing the parties with a motive to collect illegal gratification and that if the local Public Prosecutor Shri Bipin Babu is contacted the whole truth would come out. He prayed for an inquiry into the matter.
Another undated petition (annexure-2) was sent to the Registrar of this Court which is a verbatim copy of annexure-1.
A third petition dated 25-9-1974 (annex-ure-3) was addressed to the Chief Justice. It is purported to have been seat by the inhabitants of Rourkela, but not signed by any person. The additions in this annexure 3 which on translation are that
 Shri Das was collecting illegal gratification through certain lawyers, his oetich clerlcad his brother. Parties who do not bribe him are harassed. As an instance, it is said that a warrant was issued against Shri D. C. Bahali (the contemner) and as he was brought under warrant, Shri Das snatched away one hundred rupees from his pocket and then released him. The contemner and one Gitarani Bahali will bear testimony to this fact. This incident has created a flutter in Rourkela and Sunder-garh, If a judicial inquiry is held into the matter, the amount Shri Das has collected in the meantime by way of illegal gratification from Rourkela will be known and that Rou-kela had never seen before such a corrupt judicial Officer.
There the prayer was that the High Court may investigate into this and immediately get him transferred.
3. As is now evident, the contemner is the author of all annexures 1 and 2 which seem to have been despatched by post sometime, in the last week of September, 1974. There were also some other anonymous letters addressed to other Justices of the Court with copies to the Governor, Chief Minister and Supreme Court. These are in English. But the substance of all these is the same. Since some of these petitions were signed and there were grave allegations against the integrity and impartiality of a member of the Judiciary, the High Court took a serious view of the matter and dealt with it first administratively, to ascertain the truth. The Administrative Judge and the then Acting Chief Justice directed the District Judge, Sambalpur-Sundergarh on 4-12-1974 to hold a confidential inquiry and submit his report to the Court at an early date. The District and Sessions Judge examined on the spot Sri Bipin Bihari Misra, the Public Prosecutor and the Government Pleader, Rourkela; Shri Bhudeb Sarangi, Ad-vocat and Special Public Prosecutor of Polioa Department; Shri Surendra Muduli, Advocate, Rourkela; Shri Dhruba Charan Bahali (the contemner); Shri S. N. Das, Sub-ordinats Judge, Rourkela; and Shri P. Mohan-ty, Magistrate, First Class, Rourkela, all on 6-12-1974. The statements of these witnesses are on record in the administrative file which were made available to the learned Advocate for the contemner at the time of hearing. The penultimate paragraph of the report of the District and Sessions Judge who enquired into the matter is this:
4. Mr. Patnaik appearing on behalf of the contemner raised two points, namely, (a) a technical objection that in view of subsection (2) of Section 15 of the Act, in absence of a reference by the Subordinate Judge or a motion made by the Advocate General, this Court is incompetent to start a proceeding suo motu; and (b) that in case his first contention is not accepted, then in view of the unqualified apology tendered and the mental strain under which the contemner made these allegations, he may be pardoned and the rule discharged.
5. The basis of the technical objection taken by Mr. Patnaik is that under Section 15(2) of the Act, there being a specific provision for contempt of a subordinate Court, that provision alone is to be resorted to. Section 15 of the Act so far as is relevant provides
  

15, Cognizance of criminal contempt in other cases. (1) In the case of a criminal contempt, other than a contempt referred to in Section 14, the Supreme Court or the High Court may take action on its own motion or on motion made by-
2. In respect of contempt other than the contempt referred to in Sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (Act 70 of 1971), the High Court may take cognizance of contempt;
(a) suo motu;
(b) upon a petition made by the Advocate General of the State of Orissa;
 (c) xx          xx            xx
 

(d) on a reference made by a Court subordinate to it relating to contempt of such subordinate Court.
Section 15 read with Rule 2 quoted above would make it clear that the High Court is quite competent to take cognizance of contempts of Courts subordinate to it suo motu, without any reference made by any subordinate Court for the purpose. If any reference is made, that will come under Rule 2 (d). But even without it under Rule 2 (a) the High Court can suo motu take cognizance of it. These rules are in no way inconsistent with Section 15 of the Act nor there is any such challenge to that effect, Besides Section 15(1) itself envisages how the High Court may take action of all criminal contempts on its own motion, excluding only those referred to under Section 14. The expression ""may take action"" appearing in Section 15(2) does not abrogate the right conferred on the High Court under Section 15(1).
6. The Subordinate Court before whom a criminal contempt is committed may or may not refer. But want of reference under Section 15(2) is no bar for the High Court to initiate action on its own motion under Section 15(1),
 

7. The rules made under Section 23 of the Act take the point beyond the pale of controversy. The High Court may under the Rules take cognizance of contempt in four circumstances as already quoted. The first one is suo motu and the last one is upon a reference made by a Court subordinate to it. Though the four situations enumerated under the rules are exhaustive, they are not mutually exclusive or destructive for contingencies are quite foreseeable when different agencies may move independently simultaneously in ignorance of the move by another. In other words, if the High Court has taken action suo motu that does not debar the subordinate Court to make a reference under Rule 2 (d) and in such a contingency the latter will only merge in the former. This objection taken by Mr. Patnaik here has been fully discussed and finally repelled by a Full Bench of the Delhi High Court reported in 1974 Crl LJ 899 (FB) (D, B. Vohra etc). There it was held;
The word ""reference"" in Sub-section (2) in the absence of definition in the Act or any rule of procedure made under the Act, has to be interpreted in the sense of information of a particular matter. No assistance of Section 423 of Criminal Procedure Code 189S or Order 46. Rule 1 of Civil Procedure Code 1908 can be taken for its interpretation.
A statement of the subordinate Court taken by the Sessions Judge at the instance of the High Court and sent to the High Court was held to amount to a reference within the meaning of Sub-section (2).
On an interpretation of Section 15(2), their Lordships observed thus:
8. The second point urged by Mr. Patnaik was a complete exoneration and discharge of the rule issued against the con-temner because of the unconditional apology tendered by him. In that context, he stated how getting involved in several defalcation cases and under great family stress and strain in an unbalanced state of the mind, the contemner has made these allegations. The Court should accept the unconditional apology taking a sympathetic attitude. We have given our anxious consideration to this aspect of the case. Here, the contemner brought the vile allegations against the Judicial Officer as he convicted him in some defalcation cases and he had some such cases with the same Judicial Officer yet to be decided. There is nothing on record nor the circumstances indicate that really he was in such a predicament that he would have gone mad, Besides the cool and deliberate move made by him is hardly expected of a mad man. Rather they are consistent with the conduct of a designing person. His behaviour did not indicate any remorse or repentance while the Sessions Judge enquired into the matter, In this background, the only question is ""Should the apology tendered be accepted and ho be fully exonerated?"" This identical question came up for consideration before a Division Bench of this Court very recently in State v. Rama Chandra Mohapatra ((1975) 41 Cut LT 329). In that case, Ramchandra Mohapatra, the husband, lost a proceeding under Section 488, Criminal P.C. brought by his wife. So in anger he reported to the Court's superior Officer, that is, the District and Sessions Judge, Baripada that the officer passed an order in favour of his wife being in illicit love with her. The District Judge enquired into the matter and found the allegations to be baseless and false. He brought it to the notice of this Court which took suo motu action under the Act. In this Court, Ramchandra tendered an unqualified apology. Taking into consideration the trend of decisions on the point, both native and foreign and the literature on the subject, this Court did not accept the same and sentenced him to simple imprisonment for one month. The last word on the subject appears to have been very forcefully pronounced by their Lordships of the Supereme Court in the case of Mukh Raj v. State of Punjab , reference to which was made by this Court in the above case, in the following terms:
9. We are conscious of the provisions of Section 13 of the Act that even if a contempt is committed in certain cases no sentence should be imposed unless the contempt is of such a nature that it substantially interferes or tends to interfere with the duo course of justice, We have no doubt that the contempt committed in this case is of a serious nature which substantially interferes or tends to interfere with the due course of justice. It has lowered the prestige of the Officer in the estimation of the general public including the litigants who would, in the circumstances, lose all confidence in him. These are matters where the Court should not take a lenient view, thus giving a premium on unfounded baseless allegations touching the honesty and integrity of a Judicial Officerwhose lot in the present day is otherwise very much unenviable. Suffice it to say that all the annexures sent by the contemner directly come under the definition of ""criminal contempt"" as enumerated under Sections 2(c)(i) and 2(c)(iii) of the Act,
 

10. In the result, we hold that the opposite party is guilty of contempt under Section 2(c) (ii) and (iii) of the Act and he is sentenced to simple imprisonment for one month which, in the circumstances of the case, we think, would be meet and proper.
Registrar to take steps for issue of necessary warrant.
G.K. Misra, C.J.
11. I agree.

"Ranbir Chandra vs Union Of India And Ors. on 19 January, 1978",,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.(1) This Letters patent Appeal is directed against the order, dated 15th November, 1977, of the learned single Judge, by which the operation of the order of respondent No. 1, passed on 22-7-77 refixing the seniority of the appllant was stayed.  
(2) The appellant qualified for appointment as a Class I Officer, as a result of the combined competitive examination held by the Federal Public Service Commission in 1945 for Central Civil Services, including the Military Accounts Department and the Income-tax Officers Class I Grade II. He was allocated to the Military Accounts Department, which stood at par with Income-tax Officers, Class I Grade Ii Service. In that department at that time the recruitment on the results of the said examination was being made only to the Emergency Cadre to which the appellant was appointed. Even the appointments to Income-tax Officers, Class I Service were also made on temporary basis.  
(3) In June, 1950, the Special Recruitment Board interviewed Officers including the appellant, who had been appointed to the Emergency Cadre of the Military Accounts Department and put them into three categories, namely.     
 (A)Those suitable for absorption in Class I of the Military Accounts Department and Indian Audit and Accounts Service;  
 (B)Those suitable for absorption in Class Ii posts in the Income-tax Department and defense Ministry; and   

 (C)Those unsuitable for permanent appointment in either Class I or Class Ii of the Central Services.   
 THEappellant was placed in category (b) and made to join as Income-tax Officer Class II.   
(4) The appellant since then has been contending that the decision of the Board was unjust, arbitrary and erroneous on the grounds that-     
 (1)Officers of category (c) were allowed to continue in Class I in the Emergency Cadre of the Military Accounts Department and were later found fit for confirmation in Class I with benefit of retrospective seniority; and  

 (2)Officers who were placed for absorption in the Military Accounts Department by the Board were also allowed the benefit of a redetermination of their seniority on the basis of ranks obtained in the competitive examination. Thus the errors and injustice done by the Board in 19501-51 were corrected by the Government by the year 1957 by administrative decisions in respect of candidates except the appellant.  
(5) Ultimately, the appellant succeeded in convincing the Government that injustice had been done to him alone while the other persons similarly situated or less favorably situated than the appellant, were given the benefit of eligibility to appointment in Class I of the Central Services as a result of the combined competitive examination of 1945. After consulting the Union Public Service Commission and getting their approval, the Government passed the impugned order.   
(6) The reasons for the impugned order given in the affidavit of the Government, dated 25-10-1977, are as follows:-    ""ULTIMATELY,the Government of India, in consultation with the U.P.S.C. decided to refix the seniority of respondent No. 6 (the appellant here) in the Class I Service of the Income-tax Department after taking into account the totality of the circumstances and the various factors. In doing so, the Government of India have only rectified a mistake by talcing a decision which is at par with the decisions of the Military Accounts Department (now known as defense Accounts Department) whereby some other persons who were in a similar or even worse situation as respondent No. 6 were given benefits by virtually nullifying the decisions taken in 1950 in relation to the said Officers and respondent No. 6.""  
 After the passing of the impugned order, the Departmental Promotion Committee recommended the appellant for appointment as a Commissioner of Income-tax. Thereupon a writ petition was filed by 34 persons, who felt aggrieved by the new seniority given to the appellant for getting the impugned order quashed. They also applied for stay of the operation of the impugned order. The stay was granted by the learned single Judge after considering the prima facie case made out in the writ petition, the irreparable injury that would be caused to the petitioners and the balance of convenience to be taken into account in granting or refusing the stay.  
(7) We are of the view that all these three considerations operate in favor of the allowing the impugned order to stand and not granting the stay of its operation for the following reasons:-     
 THEpower of the Government to redress the injustice does not seem to have been challenged. In fact, the primary difference between the finality of a judicial decisions and the reviewability of an administrative action is clear. If the administration commits an error, it is always open to it to correct it in the interests of justice. Such action is not prevented by considerations which often prevent the review of a judicial decision on merits.   
 2.irreparable Injury   

 NOdirect injury, much less an irreparable one could be shown to be caused to any of the persons filing the writ petition by the impugned order. The said order enabled the Government to appoint the appellant to the post of a Commissioner of Income-tax. Whether any of the persons filing the writ petition would be affected by it is doubtful. The promotion of the post of Income-tax Commissioner is by selection and on merit. The refixation of seniority of the appellant which placed him above some persons previously above him does not mean that by the mere gain in seniority the appellant was entitled to be appointed as a Commissioner of Income-tax. The appointment could be made only by selection. It is not known which and if so how many of the persons filing the writ petition would be selected for appointment to the post of a Commissioner of Income-tax. They could only urge that the appellant was made senior to them. They could not urge, however, that selection was made on the basis of seniority. Assuming that some of the persons filing the writ petition would also be selected as Commissioners of Income-tax and would be junior to the appellant because of the earlier promotion of the appellant based on the impugned order, it cannot be said that this would be the result of the impugned order. On the contrary, it would be the result of the eligibility of the appellant to be considered for selection. That eligibility was given to him sheerly by considerations of justice. The first principle in entertaining a writ petition and in granting relief is to redress injustice and to advance the cause of justice. The facts are such that injustice had been done to the appellant. The redressing of such injustice was not meant to harm the interests of others. At any rate, it can not be said to cause any injustice to the writ petitioners. The extraordinary powers of this court under Article 226 should not be exercised unless considerations of justice demanded (see Shri Vashist Bhargava v. Income-tax Officer, Salary Circle, 2nd (1975) I Delhi 634(1) and the following decisions of the Supereme Court relied upon therein. namely, A.M. Alison v. B. L. Sen , State of U.P. v. Dr. Vijay Anand Maharaj, , Veerappa v. Raman, (1952) S.C.R. 583(4) at 594, D. N. Banerjee v. P. R. Mukherjee (1953) S.C.R. 302 at 305(5), Sangram Singh v. Election Tribunal, , and Durga Prasad v. The Chief Controller of Imports & Exports, .
 3.Balance of Convenience   

 THEGovernment action may be primarily classified into two, namely (1) as affection civil servants, and (2) as affecting others. The protection of the liberties of the individual by this court under Article 226 of the Constitution is mainly invoked in cases falling in class (2). The Constitutional protection given to civil servants has, however, to be taken into account. The Government action falling in class (1) may, therefore, be sub-divided as follows :    
 THEfacts of the present case do not show that a constitutional or legal right is infringed, but rather that in exercising the power of internal administration of civil services, the Government has taken an individual decision on the particular facts of one unusual case- It is primarily for the Government with the help of the Union Public Service Commission to deal with the facts of a particular case relating to a civil servant it is understood that the Union Public Service Commission took as much as three years in fully considering the case of the appellant and in advising the Government that his seniority should be refixed. When so much of consideration had been given by the appropriate authorities before the passing of the impugned order to the case of the appellant, ordinarily such a case would not qualify for this court suspending the operation of the impugned order. It is in relation to such internal administration of civil services by the Government that the following observations of Prof. Paul Apple by in Morality and Administration in Democratic Government. 81-82 (1952) are attracted :    ""WITHthe growth of knowledge, science, and public expectations, the principal development of government has been in the strictly executive field . . . The administrative search for morality is a search for appropriate ways to serve the popular will in action............However unclear the distinction between the juridic and the executive functions and processes, it seems at least more illuminating and relevant now to search for it than to go on simply defining administration as the more specific formulation of the more general legislative formulations or to build general administrative thinking around the favorite fictions of legal distinctions, 'quasi-legislative' and 'quasi-judicial'.""  
 ANOTHERwell-known political scientist Chester Bernard has warned that the lofty intrusion of the judiciary into administration may chill the creative responsibility of the administrators. His much quoted observation is that ""not to make decisions that others should make, is to preserve morals, to develop competence, to fix responsibility and to preserve authority"". (The functions of the Executive 194) (1938).   
(8) It is the general rule in writ petitions filed by civil servants that the impugned administrative action of the Government is set aside if the writ petition succeeds. The balance of convenience is in favor of not suspending the operation of the Government order. For, the individual writ petitioner can always be given the appropriate relief if his writ . petition succeeds. The Government is a Government of law. It always implements the decisions of the courts giving such reliefs to the writ petitioners. But it is extremely unusual for this court to stop the iteration of a Government order merely because the writ petition seems to make out a prima facie case. There are various consideration against such a course. Since ordinarily it is the business of the Government and the Union Public Service Commission to go into the facts of a particular case of a civil servant, their examination of facts and decision to do justice in such a case is not ordinarily interfered with by this court. The issue of a stay against the Government order obstructs the functioning of the Government. Such obstructions should be avoided initially, unless it becomes inevitable when the writ petition is disposed of on merits. Rights of third parties also get prejudiced by premature stay suspending the operation of administrative action for which no compensation can be available or sufficient. It is, therefore, only in an extraordinary case that stay is granted in a writ petition by the civil servant against the Government. For instance if the order of the Government is unjust or bona fide then consideration of justice may justify the grant of stay. In the present case, the impugned order is not said to be either unjust or bona fide. There is no reason, therefore, for departing from the usual practice of not granting stay in such a case. It is because were were impressed by the justice of the case of the appellant and no extraordinary circumstances were present to justify the suspension of the operation of the order dated 22nd July, 1977, that we thought that the stay was operating unjustly against the appellant since the appellant has only a few years to serve and it would be unjust to delay his promotion which he has got after so many years of representation, we allowed the appeal by a brief order on 13th January, 1978 and set aside the stay. But to minimise any hardship to the writ petitioners, we have advanced the date of hearing of the writ petition by the learned single judge to 15th February, 1978.   
(9) ABOVEare the reasons for the said order, which are being announced today as notified in the cause list.

Dayal,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.1. The Judge (Revisions) Sales Tax has made a reference to this Court on 1371 reference applications before him. His referring order is dated the 30th December, 1955. One common referring order was made, as the points of law raised in those applications were mostly common and could be covered by the few questions formulated by the Judge (Revisions). Out of these 1371 references, 1318 are on the applications under Section 11 of the U. P. Sales Tax Act made by the Commissioner, Sales Tax, Uttar Pradesh, and the remaining 53 are on the applications of different dealers. These applications for references were made in connection with a number of revisions which the various assessees had filed before the Judge (Revisions) against the assessment of sales tax made by the various Sales Tax Officers and for the consequential relief with respect to the refund of the amount of sales tax which the various applicants had deposited in the Government treasury.
2. The above reference arises under the following circumstances. In the U. P. Sales Tax Act, U. P. Act No. XV of 1948, the word ""sale"" was defined in Clause (h) of Section 2 and in the definition it was stated that it would include ""forward contracts."" The Sales Tax Department of the State Government accordingly started assessing sales tax on forward transactions as well. One of the assessees, by name Budh Prakash, moved a writ petition in this Court challenging the vires of the definition of ""sale"" given in the Sales Tax Act in so far as it purported to include forward transactions within its ambit. The matter came up for consideration by a Division Bench of this Court, and the Division Bench upheld the contention of Budh Prakash on the ground that the word ""sale"" in the relevant entry in Schedule 7 of the Government of India Act did not include forward transactions and the U. P. Legislature had no jurisdiction to legislate with respect to them or to impose a tax on those transactions. The State Government took the matter to the Supreme Court of India and the Supreme Court upheld the decision of this Court. The decision of the Supreme Court is reported in Sales Tax Officer, Pilibhit v. Messrs Budh Prakash Jai Prakash [1955] 1 S.C.R. 243. The learned Judges further held Explanation III to Section 2 (h), which inserted a deeming clause concerning the completion of sale on forward contracts as well as Section 3-B of the Act to be ultra vires. After the decision of the Division Bench of this Court, a number of revisions were filed by the assessees before the Judge (Revisions) claiming refund of the amounts paid by them as sales tax on forward contracts. Some others waited till the law on the point was finally declared by the Supreme Court and then filed their revisions.
3. The Judge (Revisions) set aside the assessment of sales tax, as the assessment on forward contracts had been declared illegal by this Court whose order was confirmed by the Supreme Court, but held that the amount of tax deposited could be refunded only in hose cases in which the dealers had not realised that amount from the customers and that the amount was not to be refunded in cases in which the dealers had actually realised those amounts from the customers. The Judge (Revisions) had not passed a final order but he remanded the cases to the Sales Tax Authorities for further findings and necessary assessments. The Commissioner, Sales Tax, was dissatisfied with this order so far as it held the deposited tax to be refundable in cases where the dealers had not realised it from the customers, and he filed 1318 applications for reference under Section 11 of the Sales Tax Act submitting that the following question be referred to this Court:
4. Such dealers who had realised the tax from the customers also felt aggrieved and filed 53 applications for making references praying for eight questions of law to be referred to this Court. These eight questions are to be found in the paper book of Sales Tax Reference No. 467 of 1956. It is not necessary to reproduce them here, as only two questions out of those eight are the real questions of law to be urged on behalf of those dealers. These two questions are :
5. The Judge (Revisions) formulated the following questions for the decision of this Court in his referring order :-
6. When Sales Tax Reference No. 467 of 1956 came up for hearing on the 20th December, 1956, the learned Standing Counsel asked for an adjournment of the hearing till sometime after the decision by the Supreme Court in its Civil Appeal No. 87 of 1957 (Sales Tax Officer, Banaras and Ors. v. Kanhaiya Lal Makutnd Lal Saraf Since reported in [1958] 9 S.T.C. 747.) against the judgment of this Court in Special Appeal No. 18 of 1955. The following will indicate what took place in the court on that date prior to the adjournment of the hearing to a date subsequent to the decision of the aforesaid Supereme Court appeal:
7. The Supreme Court decided its Civil Appeal No. 87 of 1957 [1958] 9 S.T.C. 747., on the 23rd September, 1958, and upheld the decision of this Court to the effect that the amount deposited as sales tax. in connection with the forward contracts was refundable in view of Section 72 of the Indian Contract Act, which covered cases of payments by mistake, be the mistake on a question of law or on a question of fact. It, however, further held, that the amount is not to be refunded in case some such circumstances existed which disentitled the assessee from claiming the refund. In view of this possible restriction on the right of a certain assessee to get the refund, the learned Adovocate-General at the commencement of the hearing submitted that what had been agreed to by the learned Standing Counsel on the 20th December, 1956, need not be taken to be sufficient for giving the answers to the questions referred. He further submitted that the question of the applicability and effect of Section 8-A (4) of the Sales Tax Act arose in. this reference and should be allowed to be urged and that the observations made by this Court in its order dated the 20th December, 1956, that that question had not been referred to the Court in this reference and the question was open need not be taken to be a final decisions of this Court on that point. Mr. Jagdish Swarup, learned counsel appearing for the assessee, agrees that the question under Section 8-A (4) is a question requiring determination in this reference. We accordingly allowed the learned Advocate-General to submit what he had to say both with respect to the circumstances which could disentitle the assessee from claiming the refund and with respect to the applicability and effect of Section 8-A(4) of the Sales Tax Act.
8. The questions formulated in the referring order require to be recast to bring out fully what was contemplated by the parties from the questions of law formulated by them for reference to this Court. We will reframe them as follows :
9. We may add a further question in view of question No. (3) in the application for reference by the dealers. This question is-
 (3) Whether in the circumstances of the case, Section 8-A (4) of the U. P. Sales Tax Act is at all applicable and is not ultra vires of the U.P. Legislature ?
10. Question No. (2) formulated in the referring order does not really arise out of the questions which the Commissioner of Sales Tax or the dealers desired to be referred. It is, therefore, not to be answered. We may however note that both the learned Advocate-General and Mr. Jagdish Swarup, learned counsel for the opposite parties, agree that there is no period of limitation provided for a claim for the refund by the assessee under the U. P. Sales Tax Act.
11. The learned Advocate-General has submitted the following circumstances in support of the contention that the assessees, who had the right to refund of the sales tax deposited, became disentitled to get it :
12. Besides these three circumstances, the other point which the learned Advocate-General has urged is that the dealer is bound to deposit this amount, which he claims as refund, in the Government treasury, in view of the provisions of Section 8-A (4) of the Sales Tax Act, as this amount of tax had been realised by him as a tax on sale of goods, when no tax was payable in respect of that sale. It may be mentioned that the learned Advocate-General does not dispute that the amount deposited by the dealers, who have not realised it from the customers, is to be refunded. He has alleged no circumstances which would justify the non-refunding of the amount to such dealers. The referring order indicates that out of 1318 cases sought to be referred by the Commissioner of Sales Tax, 1040 are the cases in which, according to the State, the amounts were actually paid by the dealers themselves from their own pockets.
13. We are of opinion that none of the circumstances urged disentitles the assessee from getting the refund to which he is entitled under Section 72 of the Contract Act, as held by the Supreme Court in its Civil Appeal No. 87 of 1957 Since reported as Sales Tax Officer, Banaras, and Ors. v. Kanhaiya Lal Makund Lal Saraf [1958] 9 S.T.C. 747, in cases in which the assessee had realised that amount from his customer. In this connection we may refer to some of the observations made in the Supreme Court judgment. After quoting at length from the observations of the Privy Council in Sri Sri Shiba Prasad Singh v. Maharaja Srish Chandra Nandi (1949) 76 I.A. 244, Mr. Justice Bhagwati, who delivered the judgment of the Court, said,
 We are of opinion that this interpretation put by their Lordships of the Privy Council on Section 72 is correct.
14. We may now quote a portion of the quotation from the Privy Council in this judgment as follows:
15. Mr. Justice Bhagwati further said later on :
16. He further said later on:
17. We take this judgment of the Supreme Court to hold that a person, who has paid money to another by mistake, be it of fact or law, is entitled to get back the money and his title to get back the money may, however, be lost to him on account of certain circumstances like estoppel, waiver, limitation or the like. No equitable consideration can take away the title to the refund of the money. The terms of Section 72 of the Contract Act are plain enough for disregarding any suggested obstacle to the payers having no right to the refund. His right exists. He may not be able to enforce it on account of certain conduct of his like that of estoppel, waiver or having taken no action to enforce his right and the period of enforcing the right having elapsed.
18. The considerations urged is this case are not of this kind. The assessee made no representation to the State and the State, in no way, acted to its detriment as a result of any representation. He made no such promise which made the State alter its position. There is no limitation for his claiming the refund under the Sales Tax Act.
19. It is not correct to say that the assessee collected the tax from the customer as an agent of the State. The Sales Tax Act in a way ignores the customer altogether. Section 3 of the Act makes a dealer liable to the payment of the tax on the basis of his turnover of the previous year. There is no provision in the Act, which says that the customer will have to pay a sales tax at such and such rate. There is not even a. provision to the effect that the dealer shall charge this amount from the customer. Section 8-A (2) of the Act prohibits an unregistered dealer from realising any tax as such on sale of goods from the purchaser. A registered dealer is not so prohibited, but he too is not bound to realise the tax from his purchaser. In case, however, he does realise the tax from his purchaser, Sub-section (3) of Section 8-A requires him to act in a certain manner. He is required to issue a signed cash memo showing separately the price for which the goods are sold and the amount realised as tax from the purchaser. He is required to keep a counterfoil and to maintain a true and correct account of all moneys realised by him as tax in the prescribed manner. We do not agree with the contention of the Commissioner of Sales Tax that the dealer collects this amount from the customer under the authority given to them under Sub-section (3) of Section 8-A. This sub-section gives no authority to realise it. The authority, if any, is a general authority of a dealer to charge what he likes from his customer. It is only when he realises the tax as a tax from his purchaser that he has to comply with the requirements of Sub-section (3).
20. The other question, that it would be inequitable to make a gift of this money to the assessee when it is not possible for him to refund it to the customer, is not material. We have already quoted from the judgment of the Supreme Court that any equitable consideration has no place in determining the rights of the assessee to get back his tax and no such consideration can certainly take away the right which the assessee otherwise possesses. Further, it may be said that it is not possible to say as a fact that the assessee will not be able to refund the realised tax to the customers. The taxes have been realised on forward transactions and it. is likely that a record has been maintained of these transactions. It cannot be denied that the customer has a right to a refund of the money from the assessee, and the question whether his claim now would be barred by time is, to say the least, highly controversial. 
21. The third circumstance, i.e., the fact that the assessee had realised tax from the customer and has not suffered any loss, is not any reason to disentitle the dealer-assessee from getting the refund to which he is entitled. If we agree with this contention, it would mean that the right given to a person under Section 72 of the Contract Act is not a plain right to a refund of the money in case it is paid by mistake but is a right to get back the money only when he has not suffered any loss on account of that payment. This would mean adding something to Section 72 of the Contract Act and will, in every case, lead to a consideration of the original source from which the person paying tax got the money. Further, this is a circumstance which goes to the right of a person to the refund of money he had paid under a mistake and is not a circumstance which should disentitle him, if he is entitled, to a refund. It is significant to mention in this connection that the person who gets the money, which he is not entitled to get, has no right to it and cannot retain it unless the person who originally paid it under a mistake had lost his right to get it back. As we have already stated above, the legal liability to pay the tax is of the dealer and he is bound to pay the tax even though he may not have recovered it from the customer. The dealer-assessee thus pays his own money to the State Government as tax and he would thus suffer a loss if the money is not refunded to him, even though he may have wrongly realised it from the customer.
22. Lastly, we have to consider the effect of the provisions of Section 8-A(4) of the Act, assuming it to be a valid enactment. Section 8-A is-
8-A. (1) Any dealer (hereinafter called 'registered dealer' may get himself registered under this section and, for that purpose, shall submit an application to the assessing authority in such manner, within such period and accompanied by such annual fee not exceeding rupees ten as may be prescribed.
(2) No person who is not a registered dealer shall realise any tax as such on sale of goods from the purchasers.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 12, any registered dealer who realizes tax as such on sale of any goods from the purchaser, shall issue a cash memo, signed by the dealer or his servant, manager or agent, to the purchaser showing separately the price for which the goods are sold and the amount realized as tax from the purchaser and shall keep a counterfoil duly signed and shall further maintain a true and correct account of all moneys realized by him as tax in the prescribed manner.
(4) Without prejudice to the previsions of Clause (f) of Section 14, the amount realized by any person as tax on sale of any goods, shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act, be deposited by him in a Government treasury within such period as may be prescribed, if the amount so realized exceeds the amount payable as tax in respect of that sale or if no tax is payable in respect thereof.
23. The contention of the learned Advocate-General is that the assessee realised the tax from the customers in connection with the forward transaction treating such transaction as a sale and that now that it had been held that a forward transaction does not amount to a sale and that no tax could be assessed on its basis, the dealer had to pay the amount of such tax realised in the Treasury. We are of opinion that what Sub-section (4) contemplates to be deposited is the amount which a person collects as tax on a transaction which is in reality a sale transaction and. not what he collects as a tax on a transaction treating it to be a sale transaction. The expression ""as tax on sale of any goods"" simply means that the amount realised should be realised as a tax. This is clear from the later expressions in the sub-section which deal with the circumstances in which such realisations are to be deposited in the Treasury. They arc to be deposited when the amount realised is in excess of the amount payable as tax in respect of that sale or if no tax is payable in respect thereof, i.e., in respect of that sale. If the transaction in connection with which the amount had been realised does not amount to a sale the later contingencies which require its deposit will not materialise and it must follow that the reference to realisation as tax on sale of any goods must be to realisation as tax in respect of a. sale of goods and not in respect of any transaction taken to be a sale even when it is not a transaction of sale. When the Supreme, Court has held that it was ultra vires of the U.P. Legislature to enact that the expression ""sale"" includes forward transaction, it must follow that that ultra vires provision never existed in the Act and that therefore a forward transaction never amounted to a sale. In this view of the matter, the amount realised by a dealer-assessee as tax from a customer in connection with a forward contract cannot be. said to be an amount realised as tax on sale of any goods and therefore such an amount is not covered by the provisions of Sub-section (4) of Section 8-A of the Act.
24. In view of our opinion about the applicability of Sub-section (4) of section 8-A of the Act, we need not express any opinion on the question with respect to the competence of the U. P. Legislature to enact this sub-section.
25. We therefore answer the re-formulated question No. 1 (a), (b) and (c) in the affirmative to the effect that the tax deposited by a dealer on forward transaction is refundable. We give no answer to question No. 2 in view of what we have said above. Our answer to the first part of question No. 3 is that Section 8-A (4) of the U.P. Sales Tax Act is not applicable in the circumstances of the case. We order the Commissioner, Sales Tax, U.P., to pay the costs of the assessee which we assess at Rs. 500.

"Collector Of Central Excise, Hyderabad vs N. Venkata Rao on 31 March, 1964",,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month. 1. This is an ap-peal against the judgment of our learned brother Justice Jaganmohath Reddy quashing an order of reversion dated 9th February 1960, made by the Collector of Central Excise.
2. The facts which are not in dispute lie in a narrow compass and may be stated thus: The petitioner, who was an Inspector of the

Central Excise, along with nine others, was promoted by an order dated the 21st April 1939 by the Collector of Central Excise to officiate as Deputy Superintendent of Central Excise (Executive) in the Central Excise Department in the scale of 260-15-350 until further orders. Formal posting orders were to be issued separately. These ten persons were selected out of a list of 266 Inspectors tormina the field of choice for promotion and that the respondent's rank in the list was at 262. We are told by the counsel for the respondent that these 260 did not exhaust all the Inspectors. This list was prepared out of the then existing 800 Inspectors. On the 9th of February 1960, the impugned order was made by the same Collector. Having regard to the part this order plays in the context of this enquiry, it is profitable to set it out in extenso. 
 3. It is pertinent to note here that it was the petitioner and the four others who ranked as Nos. 1 to 5 in the earlier order that were reverted. But temporary promotion of officers Nos. 6 to 10 shown in the original order was allowed to stand for the reason that in the list which was framed as the basis of the field of choice, they were within the first 7 ranks. It is to remove on certiorari the latter order that writ petition No. 506/1960 was filed. 
 4. The chief ground urged in the petition was that the order impeached did not contain any reasons for the reversion and that the order was vitiated for non-disclosure of reasons and that secondly, the reversion amounted to a reduction in rank, so as to fall within the protection of Article 311(2) of the Constitution and that the requirements of this article were not fulfilled. These two grounds found favour with our learned brother, with the result that the impugned order was quashed. Dissatisfied with that judgment the Collector of Central Excise has brought this appeal. 
 5. It is contended by the learned Government Pleader in support of this appeal that as the respondent was promoted to officiate until further orders, the reversion without assignment of reasons was not invalid or illegal and that this reversion did not attract Article 311(2) or any of the relevant statutory rules, as it was not by way of punishment that the respondent was reverted. 
6. On the other hand, it is argued by Shri Ramachandra Rao, learned counsel for the respondent, that the Collector was under an obligation to give reasons for reversion and that since the reversion has certain consequences flowing therefrom, it should be regarded as a punishment so as to fall within the contemplation of Rule 13 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1957. 
 A point also was raised for the first time that in any event the order of the Collector has to be struck down as he did not exercise his

judgment and that he merely gave effect to the behests of the Central Board of Revenue. We shall deal with these contentions seriatim. 
 7. We must observe that the first branch of the contentions is devoid of substance. At the outset it must he remembered that the respondent was to officiate as Deputy Superintendent of Contral Excise until further orders. Therefore, this is not a case where he was holding a substantive post. The office he held was of a tiansitory character and he did not acquire any right thereto. That being the real position, we are inclined to think that the Collector was under no duty to assign reasons for reversion. 
 8. Tt is in this context that the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sukhbans Singh v. State of Punjab,  called in aid by our learned brother becomes relevant.
 There, the appellant who was directly recruited as Tahsildar and who was appointed temporarily us an Extra Assistant Commissioner on probation, was reverted some years after this appointment. After an unsuccessful attempt made by him to have this order revised by the departmental authorities, be sought the aid of the High Court of Punjab under Article 226 of the Constitution, contending that the order was mala fide and that he was reverted by way of punishment, without giving him a reasonable op-portunity within the connotation of Article 311 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed it being of the opinion that the relevant statutory provisions did not require the proper authorities to disclose reasons for the reversion and that it did not operate as a punishment contemplated by Article 311 and as such it was not necessary to afford him a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the proposed action. 
 9. On an appeal by the aggrieved oiiicer, the Supereme Court reversed the order of the High Court having come to the conciusion that though the phraseology in the order was innocuous and did not show that the olficer was being punished, the attending circumstances established that the fiction of the Government was mala fide and the reversion is by way of punishment without complying with the provisions of Arlicle 311(2). 
 The sequence of events there was that there was a departmental enquiry against him and although he was exonerated, he was transferred to another place and he was also deprived of the authority of collecting donations tor a college. Their Lordships further took into account the fact that the appellant stood first in the Division in relation to the land revenue collection and that he had collected large sum of money for Red Cross ""which was an outstanding performance"" and for which he received the ""Government of Punjab commendation certificate"". Moreover the appellant there had received the ""President of India's Sanad and Silver Medal"" for his excellent work in the census of 1951. Shortly after this he was reverted and that though no reasons were stated at the time, a year and a half later after the reversion, he received a warning from the Government. It is in these circumstances that the inference was drawn that the reversion was by way of punishment. 
 10. We are not satisfied that this case has any analogy here. 
 11. That apart, in this very judgment their Lordships said: 
12. There are oilier decisions of the Supreme Court which vonch the proposition that in re verting a person officiating in higher service no reasons need be recorded. In State of Bombay v. F. A. Abraham,  the Supreme Court made observations to the same effect.
 13. In view of these decisions and in view of the absence of any provision which calls upon the appointing authority to assign reasons for reversion of a promotee on a temporary basis of his substantive office, this contention was not persisted in. 
 14. However, it was strenuously contend-ed that this reversion has all the characteristics of a punishment falling within the purview of Rule 13 mentioned above and Article 311 of the Constitution. In support of this contention, the learned compel has drawn our attention to the oft quoted case of Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India, ,  and P. C. Wadhwa v. Union of India, .
 15. Before we deal with this contention and refer to the rulings, we will do well to extract Rule 13 which framed the corner-stone of the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent. Rule 13 in so far us if is relevant is in these words: 
 16. We are not concerned with (he other penalties in this case. This rule has an explanation which may be extracted here, omitting the unnecessary portions thereof: 
 17. It is seen that this rule enumerates the penalties that can be imposed on a delinquent officer and the rule which is material for our enquiry is Sub-rule (iv) which speaks of reduction to lower service. It is not disputed that this does not cover a reversion of an officia-ting officer to a substantive post, since it refers only to a person holding a substantive post and does not extend to an officiating post. It is for this reason that the learned counsel invites us to read Clause (iv) of the Explanation along with this and hold that the reversion in this case constituted a reduction to a lower service. According to him, this is the effect of the combined reading of these two provisions, since the reversion in this case does not fall within the ambit of Clause (iv) of the explanation. 
 18. We are unable to accede to this proposition. All that the explanation postulates is that even if a person after trial was found to be unsuitable, for such higher service, grade or post, or on administrative grounds unconnected with his conduct, it should not be regarded as a penalty. It does not follow from this that reversions which are not specified within this clause automatically constitute a penalty. This clause does not seek in exhaustively set out all cases of inversions not amounting to penalty. The only purport of this clause is that even an extreme case of a person being found to be unsuitable after trial and being reverted from a higher service, grade or post does not amount to a initially within the contemplation of Rule 13(iv). This clause does not cany with it the implication that all other cases of reversion from higher service, though made on a temporary basis and until further orders, as in this case would amount to penally. We are not, therefore, disposed to share the view of the learned counsel on the interpretation of Clause (iv) of the explanation read with Sub-rule (iv) of Rule 13. If the reversion does not partake the character of a punishment, then the provisions of Article 311(2) are not attracted and therefore the procedure indicated therein need not be followed. Consequently, the impugned order of the Collector cannot be challenged on the ground of non-compliance with the provisions of Article 311(2).
 19. We will next take up another limb of the argument of the learned counsel for the respondents, that since certain penal consequences flow from this reversion, viz., that the respondent's chances of promotion are jeopardised by this reversion, it should be deemed to be a punishment. We do not think that the consequences that flow from the reversion could be described as penal. The concept of penal consequences has no place in a case of reversion of an officer officiating on a temporary basis and that is appropriate only when the reversion is by way or punishment. The learned counsel urges that whatever might be the reason or the cause of this reversion, it should be regarded as a punishment, since it affects certain rights of the officer. We are unable to accede to this interpretation of the order and of the decisions cited by him. 
 20.  called in aid by the learned counsel does not furnish any basis for this contention. The appellant there was appointed to the higher post on an officiating basis and was reverted for want of vacancies. He was not given an opportunity to show cause why he should not be reverted. The question arose whether the order was bad for non-observance of the terms of Article 311(2) of the Constitution. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court answered it in the negative for these reasons: 
 While discussing the question as to whether this reversion amounted to a reduction in rank, their Lordships laid down certain dicta which formed the foundation of the several decisions subsequently. The tests laid down by them may be usefully extracted here: 
 21. It is thus clear that it is only in cases where certain consequences flow, namely, the loss of pay and allowances, bar ot promotion or minimising the chances of promotion, that the requirements of Article 311 should be complied with. His Lordship Chief Justice S. R. Das has emphasised in the earlier portion of the passage extracted above that termination of services per se or in accordance with the terms of a contract or the terms of a specific rule does not attract Article 311(2), since it did not carry with it the penal consequence of loss of pay or allowance under Rule 32 of the Fundamental Rules analogous to Rule 13 of the pre sent rules. His Lordship goes further and remarks that even if inefficiency, negligence, misconduct or other disqualification were be the motive or the inducing factor which influenced the Government to take action under the terms of the contract of employment, nonetheless, it would be irrelevant so long as the termination was founded on the right accruing on the con tract or service rules. 
 It appears from the latter part of the judgment that the real test for determination whether, the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order for reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences and if that order entails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rant, or the stoppage or postponement of his future chalices of promotion, then that circumstances would indicate that although in form the Government had purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules, in truth and reality the Government has terminated the employment as and by way of penalty. This judgment, therefore, does not lend any support to the contention advanced on behalf of the respondent. 
 22. Nor does  advance the case of the respondent any further. As already stated, it was there found that the reversion of the officer was by way of punishment, 

though in form it appeared to be one of simple reversion. It was not laid down as a broad proposition of law that in every case of reversion of an officer from an officiating post, which is transitory in character, should be viewed as a punishment. 
 23. Nor does  render any service to the respondent. It was there found that the reversion was mala fide and was by way of punishment, though the language of the order of reversion did not disclose it and appeared to be one of simple reversion. While holding that the reversion there was in the nature of a punishment, Acting Chief Justice S.K. Das, who spoke for himself and another learned Judge, wanted to make it clear that ""when a person is reverted to his substantive rank, the question of penal consequences in the matter of forfeiture of pay or loss of seniority must be considered in the context of his substantive rank and not with reference to his officiating rank from which he is reverted, for every reversion must necessarily mean that the pay will be reduced to the pay of the substantive rank."" This observation furnishes an effective answer to the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent or that every reversion resulting in loss of pay or allowances and deprivation of chances of promotion should be regarded as by way of punishment and it is only in the context of the substantive rank that these considerations are relevant. So, this judgment renders a positive disservice to the respondent. 
 24. That every reversion from a higher post held by an officer on a temporary basis and until further orders, does not amount to a reduction in rank also appears from  It was laid down there that a person officiating in a post has no right to hold it for all time and that there was no reduction in rank for it was the very term on which he had been given the officiating post. 
 25. Another judgment of the Supreme Court which is in the same trend of thought is Union Territory of Tripura v. Gopal Chandra, . In that case, since they found that there was no ground for inferring that the Superintendent of Police was camouflaging an order of termination of employment in the exercise of the authority under the relevant rules, it could not be assumed that an order ex facie one of termination of employment of temporary employee was intended to be one of dismissal. They further held that the onus was upon the employee to show that the intention of the authority terminating the employment was to punish him in the guise of terminating the temporary employment or reverting an officiating higher post.
 26. Thus, these rulings do not afford any assistance to the respondent, on the other hand, they stress the fact that unless the reversion from an officiating higher post temporarily was by way of punishment, it would not constitute a reduction in rank. We find there is no scope for invoking Rule 13 or Article 311, since it is not the respondent's case that the Collector wanted to punish this officer and the four others by reverting them to their substantive posts. If the termination is founded on the very terms

of the original order, which has given them the right to hold the post, it does not carry with it the evil consequence and cannot be described as a punishment. 
 27. The complaint of the respondent that there was no justification for reverting the people who are given higher ranks in the order dated 21st April, 1959 while those holding ranks Nos. 6 to 10 were allowed to continue in their officiating positions, is not well founded. We have already stated that Nos. 6 to 10 in the original order were within the first seven ranks, whereas the respondent, as we have already pointed out held rank No. 262 and the four others held ranks Nos. 80, 91, 102 and 148. Nor the circumstances that a seniority was fixed as among those promoted to officiate invests the appointment with a substantive character. It does not make any difference for the transitory nature of the post. The fact that the respondent and the four others were given seniority over Nos. 6 to 10 in the original appointment does not convert that order into a substantive one. We are, therefore, unable to give effect to the contention that the reversion in the instant case was by way of punishment and that since there was non-fulfilment of the provisions of Article 311(2) the order should struck down as void. 
 28. There remains the argument that the order of reversion is void for the reason that the Collector of Central Excise has merely given effect to the directions of the Central Board of Revenue and did not exercise his independent judgment. This submission is founded on the observations of our learned brother in his order and also on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Police, Bombay v. Gordhandas Bhanji,  .
 29. At the inception, it must be remembered that this was not a point taken in the writ petition, nor has our learned brother struck down the order of the 9th February 1960 on the ground now urged by the learned counsel. This point does not seem to have been agitated before our learned brother. It is only incidentally that our learned brother has made this observation. It was in the context of the question whether there are any reasons for reverting the respondent from the officiating post of the Deputy Superintendent (Executive) of the Central Excise, that he made the following observations: 
 30. Even otherwise, there is no substance in this contention. The judgment of the

Supreme Court in  clearly lays clown the principle that the officer issuing the orders is not precluded from taking the views or the wishes of the higher authorities into consideration. All that is stated in that pronouncement was that he should not surrender his own judgment and carry out the behests of the higher authorities. In the case under citation, the Commissioner of Police who cancelled the licence wrote to the licensee, ""I write to inform you that the permission granted to your client was cancelled under the orders of the Government who may be approached."" In dealing with this order, Justice Base, who spoke for the court, observed: 
 31. Surely, it cannot be posited in this case that the Collector has acted as mere transmitting agent. In fact, his order does not refer to the directions or wishes of the Board of Revenue. He has referred to the facts that the earlier order of promotion was to be in effect until further orders and that he was reverting him in pursuance of those orders. It is not possible to say that the impugned order is of the same character as that fell to be interpreted by the Supreme Court in the case under citation. 
 32. For these reasons, we hold that even if it is permissible for the respondent to raise this argument for the first time before us, this has no force. 
 33. In the result, the appeal is allowed and
the writ petition dismissed with costs through
out.    Advocate's  fee  Rs.   100.

Of India on 25 July, 1990",,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.1. A question touching the law of limitation arises for decision in this appeal. In a sense, it has general application. Though many principles are settled in that area, nice distinctions were sought to be made out on behalf of the appellant. Driven to the wall, the appellant had necessarily to take an extreme position necessity is the mother of invention.
2. The plaintiff lost its suit for a declaration that the levy of central excise was without the authority of law. The levy was made by an order dated 4-3-1975 and despatched to the plaintiff on 22-3-1975. In essence, the controversies centred round the inclusion of the cost of paper covering in the rectangular aluminium strips. The assessing authority in the order Extn. 81 took the view that duty was leviable only under Item 27(b). According to the appellant, duty was imposable only under Item No. 68 relating to rectangular aluminium conductors.
3. The levy was complained against in an appeal, filed belatedly on 10-1-1976.The appeal was rejected as barred by time. A revision suffered the same fate by order dated 19-3-1977 served on the plaintiff on 30-4-1977.
4. Soon thereafter the authorities hurried with the recovery steps. A demand for payment made by letter Ext. A7. dated 25-5-1977 was resisted by the reply Ext. A4 dated 6-6-1977.
5. With a Damocles sword of coercive recovery process hanging over its head, the Court's jurisdiction under Article 226 was invoked by the plaintiff by filing writ petition. O.P. No. 2711 of 1977. The writ petition was also dismissed. As the law stood at that time, the authorities had no power to condone the delay in filing the appeal or revision. Remedies indicated internally under the statute, and externally by the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution were thus unavailable to the plaintiff.
6. The plaintiff then approached the civil court, by filing the suit in the sub-court, Irinjalakuda on 14-7-1980. The court found the suit not maintainable in that court. The plaint was re-presented before the Sub Court, Parur.
7. The defendants, the Govt. of India, the Asst. Collector of Central Excise and the Supdt. of Central Excise, Alwaye, resisted the suit on various contentions including the one on limitation. The trial court found the levy to be erroneous and the suit to be maintainable, but barred by time.
8. The court below took the view that the period of limitation would start running from the date of the final order Ext. A3 dated 19-3-1977. According to the plaintiff, a cause of action arose only on 25-5-1977 when a demand was made for the difference in duty. The defendants contended that demand had been made even earlier on 15-5-76 by the service of Ext. 85 order. According to the court below, the notice Ext. A7 dated 25-5-77 had in turn referred to the earlier order Ext. B5. That was issued on 15-5-1976.
9. The court below took the view that the cause of action should be reckoned from the date of demand Ext. B5 on 15-5-1976. The plaintiff could not pick and choose a date on which the right to sue had accrued. It applied Article 113 of the Limitation Act and non-suited the plaintiff. It is now clear that in the relevant Article applicable to a suit of this nature is Article 58 of the Limitation Act, 1963. That article reads as follows:
10. Mark the difference in the two Articles. Article 120 in the 1908 Act, and Article 113 of the 1963 Act merely mention ""when the right to sue accrues"". Even then that Article had received judicial interpretation. Indicating that limitation would start from the date of the first accrual of the cause of action. (Vide Rukkmabal v. Laxminarayan. A.I.R. 1960 S.C. 335; Maharajah of Pithapuram v. Venkataraju, A.I.R. 1949, Madras 542), and in particular, the sentence regarding:
It is difficult to assume that Ext. B5 would not furnish a cause of action. That order had all the power and potency to invade the plaintiff's rights. Such an invasion can be treated as the sine qua non of cause of action. Doubtless a cause of action arose on that date in that view of the matter. May be, in the scheme of a taming statute like the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, further demands or reminders might arise, if there had been modification of the order by the superior statutory authorities, or if there be non-payment after the original demand. Assuming that causes of action would arise on such occasions of renewed or further demands, that will not obliterate the fact that a cause of action had arisen when the demand had been first made.
11. The position undergoes a change, when, consequent upon a superior decision, the original order becomes merged in an appellate, revisional or other order. The first order disappears from the scene altogether. Only one is visible, namely the ultimate order. Only one cause of action is therefore positable namely that which arose on the basis of the ultimate order. Limitation has to be computed from the date of the ultimate order, in all such cases where there is such a merger. This proposition is also now settled by the authoritative pronouncement of the Supereme Court. See Raghubir Jha v. State of Bihar - A.I.R. 1986 S.C. 508. 
12. What will be the position if an appeal is not entertained on the ground that it was barred? The theory of merger has obviously no application in such a situation according to the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P. (1989) 4 S.C.C. 582. Though it concerns a case of disciplinary proceedings, the principle has applicability in other situations too. As has been already noticed above, the statute itself, as it stood at the relevant time, did not contain even a power which would enable the authorities to condone the delay. There is therefore no possibility whatever of a merger, if an appeal is not filed within the time. Article 58 will get attracted with its emphasis on the date on which the cause of action first arose.
13. A more elaborate discussion is unnecessary in view of the detailed discussion and clear pronouncement of the Supreme Court in (1989) supra.
14. In the light of the above discussion, we have necessarily to hold that the suit filed much beyond three years after the service of Ext. B5 demand, was barred by time. The conclusion of the court below is therefore sustainable for the reasons indicated above. We therefore dismiss the appeal, but without any order as to costs.

"Mrs. Meera Puri vs The State Of Nagaland on 18 September, 1970",P.K. Goswami,"Take notes as you read a judgment using our Virtual Legal Assistant and get email alerts whenever a new judgment matches your query (Query Alert Service). Try out our Premium Member Services -- Sign up today and get free trial for one month.1. This appeal is against the judgment of conviction Under Section 302, Penal Code, and sentence of imprisonment for life. The accused (Mrs. Meera Puri) is the wife of a certain Major in 10 Assam Rifles described as Major Puri, stationed at Mokokchung in Nagaland.
2. The prosecution ease is briefly as follows: On 4th April, 1969, at about 5.00 P. M., the deceased Miss Alemnaro Ao, a young girl of about ten years of age, was going by the circular road at Mokokchung with her mother Mrs. Asangla Ao (P.W. a), her aunt Miss Amenla Ao (P.W. 4) and her two cousins, who were the daughters of Obangtemjen Ao (P.W. 1). P.W. 1 has married the sister of P.Ws. ii and 4. This small party walking by theroad saw so me edible leaves below the road and the children went down to pick these up. At this time, two ladies were seen in the compound of Major Puri's house at a short distance from the hospital road which is at a higher level than the house situated on a slope of a hill. The area is hilly. The two ladies came down to the corner of their compound and shouted ""Jao Jao"". Alter that, two dogs came barking at them. Some earth was pelted at the dogs by the mother. The mother also called back the children to return. As the party was about to return, a 'Thak' Bound of a gunfire was heard and when they looked towards the side from which the sound was coming, they saw the accused lowering down a gun. The deceased was hit by a bullet and she immediately gave out that ""Mother, out of the two ladies the younger one has shot me"". The daughter was picked up by the mother and P.W. 4 was sent to report to P.W. 1. He came within about fifteen minutes and took the child to the military hospital, where however there was no doctor available and in an army vehicle she was brought to the civil hospital where the doctors treated her. The small child died two days after on 6th April, 1969 at 9-00 A. M. On the above facts, the accused stands charged Under Section 302, Penal Code for committing murder by intentionally or knowingly causing the death of Alemnaro Ao by firing at her with a .22 bore rifle.
3. Prosecution has examined sixteen witnesses, out of which P.Ws. 2, 4, 10 and 11 are the eye witnesses to the occurrence. Prosecution rests on their evidence as also on a statement of the deceased recorded by the doctor Longri Ao (P.W. 3) prior to her death. The statement is marked as Ext. P-3. Prosecution also examined Dr. L. M. Murry (P.W. 5), who found on postmortem examination one perforated wound on the left iliac fossa 1 1/2"" medial to the left illi chest and another perforated wound at the back on the tip of the left 12th rib. There was no charring or blackening at or near the wound. On internal examination, he found small perforation in the small intestine at four places and one perforation in the large intestine. There was a tear in mesentery which had torn several mesentery vessels. There was also a perforating wound at the paoas muscle on the left side. Blood had collected in the peritoneal cavity. The first perforating wound was through and through and it corresponded to the second perforating wound at the back. No bullet was found inside the body. The size of the wound was quite small and he is not quite sure whether it could be caused by .22 bore bullet. He however opined that the injury was caused by some small bore fire arm. In bia opinion, death was caused due to intra peritoneal bleeding with generalised peritonitis causing circulatory failure and in the ordinary course it waa sufficient to cause death, In crosa.examination he states that he has not given the measurements of the wounds. The bask wound was about 4"" higher in level than the front wound. He himself has fire arm and he knows its use.
4. Mr. N. Jauhari (P.W. 9) is the Assistant Director of Central Forensic Laboratory cum-Assistant Chemical Examiner to the Government of India in Calcutta. He is the Ballistic Expert to whom the rifle 'which waa produced by the husband of the accused and the ammunitions which were seized from the accused's house with the Samiz, underwear and frock which were in the wearing of the deceased were sent for examination by the police along with the report of the post mortem. He submitted his report Ext. P-7. He stated in court that after chemical examination he found that the rifle bore evidence of being fired before it was received by him. It was however not possible to give its duration. He examined the three garments. No blackening or charring was found around the bole in the garments. He could not give the distance of firing. The frock and the underwear were found to have one hole each corresponding to the wound on the left iliac fossa. No hole corresponding to the second wound on the tip of the left 12th rib could be found on any of the garments. P.W. 9 states that in the event of the frock hanging in the normal manner, this suggests the possibility that the holes in the garments are the holes through which the bullet entered before causing the wound on the left iliac fossa, According to him, it probably came out of the second wound of the left 12th rib but failed to penetrate the frock. The fact that the wound on the left 12th rib is located at a place where the body was not covered by the underwear could account for the absence of another hole in the underwear. He however stated that these observations needed confirmation in the light of observations made by the autopsy surgeon about the nature and appearance of the two wounds. Spectrogaphic examination revealed lead around the edges of the holes of the garments. The visual appearance of the holes was also similar to that produced by firing the ammunition seized from the accused's rifle (Ext. M. 4). He therefore concluded that the holes in the.garments could be produced by .22 bore rifle shot. He stated in the course of cross-examination that due to loss of energy it is possible that the bullet may not have passed through the garments after passing through the body and hence might have fallen down at the place where the victim was hit. He fired Eeven rounds from the seized rifle for experiment and tested by firing one round on a piece of cloth taken from the frock. Prom the evidence of the doctor as well aa the Ballistic Expert, it is established that the wounds found on the person of the deceased were caused by a bullet injury. We are also satisfied that that bullet was fired from the rifle seized from the accused's husband. The Ballistic Expert fired one round from this rifle with a bullet seized from the house of the accused through a piece of cloth taken from the frock and he has therefore sufficient materials on which he based his con. elusion, and we are satisfied that it is safe to depend upon his opinion. We are also satisfied that the child died as a consequence of the bullet injury.
5. The most important question is who has caused the bullet injury on the person of the deceased. The occurrence took place at about 5.00 P.M. After about fifteen minutes, P.W. 1 arrived and he sent the first information report to the Thana which was registered at about 6-00 P.M. P.W. 1 ia a Gazetted Officer and relation of the deceased. At the time of occurrence, P.W. 2 and the deceased were living with him. In the brief written report to the police station, he merely stated that ""one small girl named Alemnaro was shot at in abdomen from one quarter of Assam Rifles and now in military hospital. Kindly do necessary action immediately."" It is therefore submitted on behalf of the accused that the absence of the name of the accused in the first information report goes to show that no one knew who had fired from the rifle. P.W. 1, in the course of cross-examination, has stated that before he bad sent the written report to the police he was informed by the mother of the injured girl that the shot was fired at from Major Puri's house. He also stated in examination in chief that when the injured girl was taken from the place of occurrence to the Military Hospital, she had pointed out the house from where she was fired at by a lady after taking aim fit her. He also stated that P.W. 4 had met him as he was coming down from his house which is about two furlongs from the place of occurrence. She did not tell him who had fired. He also did not ask her about it. He further stated in cross-examination that after the arrest was made, he came to know that a woman was involved in the case. It is submitted that the evidence of P.Ws. 2 and 4 is unreliable judged from the evidence of P.W. 1 and the absence of the name of the accused in the first information report. Toe first information report is not a piece of substantive evidence. It is difficult to accept the argument that from mere absence of the name of the accused in the first information report, the entire evidence of P.W. 2 and 4 should be rejected. The first information report can be used to corroborate the statement of the informant or to contradict him. But, because of some infirmity in the first information report given by a witness who has not seen the occurrence, the evidence of the eye-witnesses cannot be rejected if otherwise the evidence is trustworthy. One has to re. member that P.W. 1 is a Government Officer and having not seen the occurrence, even if he could gather about the identity of the accused, he might feel hesitant to immediately put it in writing and might have intended only to set the police in motion for investigating into the case. Besides, the deceased being a relation and a small girl, he was more concerned about the medical attention which she would immediately need, rather than think about any other thing. We are therefore unable to give undue importance to the absence of the name of the accused in the first information report lodged in this case.
6. P.W. 2 states that when the dogs came barking at them, she requested the owner to call back the dogs and the owner was Mrs, Major Puri. She knew the accused from before the occurrence. She also knew the other lady who was standing there. She was the Ayah of Mrs. Puri. The age of the Ayah is about 40 years. The accused being about 22 years at the time of the occurrence must be the younger of the two ladies. There is absolutely no doubt that in the compound of the accused there were only two ladies, the dogs and two men in the neighbourhood. P.W. 2 in court has stated that ""after hearing that 'Thak' sound I looked that side and saw the lady (points out towards the accused) taking down a gun. My daughter told me that ''mother, out of the two ladies the younger one has shot me"". This is the first oral statement made by the deceased with regard to the bullet injury which later caused her death. This statement made by the de. ceased immediately she has received the injury is corroborated by her dying declaration re. corded next morning in the hospital. There she said:
7. P.W. 4 is the other eye-witness who has corroborated P.W. 2. She knew the accused as wall as the Ayah from before the occurrence. She had often seen the Ayah carrying a baby. She stated that as they were about to go back. ""Thak''sound of gunfire was heard. She looked that aide and saw the gun being lowered by the accused (pointing out towards the accused). She further stated that the deceased pressed her stomach and said that out of the two ladies the younger one had fired at her and so saying she collapsed. She immediately went home and found that one of the two other small girl had already informed P.W. 1 and when she reached home P.W. 1 was already stepping down from the house to proceed to the place of occurrence. She stated in cross-examination that when the lady was seen lowering down the gun, there were two men also in the neighbourhood and the Ayah was near the baby. She had not seen those men when the dogs were set at them with the words 'Jao Jao'. She was asked in cross-examination whether she stated specifically before the police that one of the two ladies was ""wife of that Major"". She replied: ""I had stated before the Police like that"". The police officer (P.W. 14), however, proved that she had not stated before him that one of those two ladies was ""wife of that Major"".
8. Major Jagjit Singh (P.W. 10) is another eye-witness. In 1969 he was posted to Transport Platoon of the Assam Rifles at Mofaok-ehung. He was transferred from Mokokchung in September 1969 and he was stationed tit Kerala before proceeding on leave to his borne town at Patiala, from where he came and gave evidence in January, 1970. He saw the co-occurrence from the gate of the Gurdwara which was nearby and ha was their with a carpenter (P.W. 11) who was called to take measurement of the gate of the Gurdwara. Ma stated as follows:
9. Mangha Singh (P.W. 11) is the remaining eye-witness- He is a carpenter and he corroborates P.W. 10. He stated that ""when the children reached the bend, I heard a sound of 'tak' and saw Memsaheb with a rifle on her shoulder. It was a .22 bore rifle. I knew Memsaheb very well since before. She is present here in court (points out towards the accused)."" He has deposed about some approach by tha accused's relations to prevail upon him not to give evidence. The trial court haa also observed the demeanour of this witness and accepted his evidence as reliable. He stated in cross-examination that due to fear he had not gone to the place of occurrence himself. Ho also did not tell anyone about his seeing the occurrence at that time. He further stated that he was examined by the police 5 or 6 day3 after the occurrence and was called to the police station for that purpose. The approach of the accused's servant and relation was after about 10 or 15 days of the occurrence. He also admits that P.W. 10 had helped his wife during her serious illness when the witness was away from home. It is strenuously contended that this witness is a false witness on his own evidence as he was examined by the police only on the 30th of April, whereas he has stated in bis evidence that he was examined 5 or 6 days after the occurrence. We are not prepared to reject the entire testimony on the sole ground that he has stated before the court that ha was examined by the police 5 or 6 days after the occurrence, when, in fact, the police officer had deposed that he was examined 26 days after the occurrence. He has corroborated the evidence of P.Ws. 1 and 2 regarding the circumstances in which the incident has taken place and it is difficult to hold that he would be deposing falsely against the accused only at the request of P.W. 10 against whom also no grudge has been established. We therefore accept his evidence as reliable.
10. It is also pointed out by the learned Counsel that the learned Judge has not relied upon the evidence of P.Ws. 2 and 4 with regard to the identity of the accused. It is well settled that even if the trial court rejects certain evidence there is no legal bar in the appellate court accepting such evidence if it appears to be trustworthy after considering the entire evidence independently. It is how-ever true that the appellate court in doing so will give due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court. In this case, how-ever, the trial court has not absolutely rejected the testimony of P.Ws. 2 and 4. It has accepted their testimony on all matters except with regard to the identity of the accused on the ground that these two witnesses have not identified the accused in a test identification parade arranged by the police. If therefore we are satisfied that the identity of the accused is satisfactorily established, this observation of the trial court would not be of much consequence. We also do not think that absence of a test identification parade in this case is of great consequence. P.Ws. 2 and 4 knew the accused from before and knew her to be the wife of the Major. In this view of the matter, the test identification parade would not be of great weight. As pointed out earlier, the fact that the deceased immediately shouted out that the younger of the two ladies had fired and there were only two ladies, the accused and her Ayah who was much older than the former, and the Ayah being busy with the baby the identity of the accused is clearly established in the evidence. Both P, Ws. 2 and 4 state about the deceased's immediate statement after being bit by the bullet and this statement has not at all been challenged in cross examination. The deceased also made a similar statement in the dying declaration. P.Ws. 10 and 11 have also identified her having seen her with the rifle in her hand immediately after the report of the gun fire. We have, therefore, no hesitation in coming to the conclusion in agreement with the finding of the trial court that the accused fired from the rifle that has been seized and the bullet discharged from the rifle in her hand hit the deceased.
11. Having arrived at this conclusion, (he next important question is what offence has been committed by the accused. In other words, has the ; offence Under Section 302, Penal Code, been made out Mr. J. P. Mitter, the learned Counsel for the accused, has drawn our attention to the following observations in the judgment of the trial court .
 In the instant case the accused has not pleaded that she had fired the shot to drive away the dogs which were running after the girl and by accident or by mistake the bullet had hit the unfortunate girl, or that she had fired the shot only to frighten away the girls without meaning to hit them, but by mistake one of the girls was hit. In the first case only an offence Under Section 301A, Penal Code might have been made out and in the other under S. 304A or at worst Under Section 304, Penal Code, In either case the punishment would have been quite light and even might have consisted of heavy fine only. However, no such pleading or even suggestion was made. On the other hand the accused had totally denied the entire occurrence.
It is not correct in law that unless an accused takes a specific plea by way of defence he may be deprived of the benefit of a position to which he may be entitled in law emerging out of the evidence and circumstances disclosed in the trial. The learned Counsel relying on the above observations of the trial court has strenuously argued that no case Under Section 302, Penal Code, has been made out and there is no question of oven conviction Under Section 304-A, Penal Code. When this was put to the learned Advocate-General, Nagaland, who is appearing on behalf of the State, he contends that according to him the charge has been made out and, at any rate, there is no escape from conviction Under Section 304-A, Penal Code. We have seen from the evidence of the Ballistic Expert that he could not give any idea about the distance from which the bullet was tired. We have however the evidence of the eye-wit-nesses wherefrom it is clear that the distance is not too far as the nearest point of the circular road near-about which the deceased was standing would be 35 to 40 yards from the accused's quarter. P, W. 9 has also stated that due to loss of energy the bullet may not have passed through the garments and might have fallen down where the victim was hit. The bullet was however not found at the place of occurrence, nor was it found inside the body. The entire area was hilly and the place from where the accused fired was lower than where the deceased was standing. According to P.W. 10, the children were outside the compound on a slope which wa3 higher than the roof of Major Puri's house. He also stated in cross-examination that there was a temporary telephone post on the circular road which was more or leas in line with the residence of Major Puri,Mr. Mitter submitted that the injury could only have been caused by a bullet which had touched off some object and in consequence ricocheted at. an angle before hitting the child and that the angle which the bullet had thus ricocheted was reflected in the injury itself. The examination of the Ballistic Expert was not adequate and it is not possible on the evidence as it is to come to a conclusion one way or the other on the point raised by the learned Counsel. It is however difficult to say that there is no force in the submission made by the learned Counsel. It is therefore possible that the accused might have fired the shot to scare away the dogs or to divert the attention of the charging dogs from the children. The children wore already alarmed and the mother was throwing earth towards the dogs who were running after the children. We are therefore prepared to give the accused benefit of doubt with regard to the offence Under Section 302, Penal code, and hold her not guilty under that section. We are not satisfied that the accused intended to cause death of the deceased by firing or knew that by this act of hers she would cause death of the deceased. That how-over does not absolve her from the responsibility for her reach and negligent act in firing towards the dogs with the children about, in a way completely regardless of the safety of human life in an undulating hilly area as it is. The accused let go the loaded rifle rashly and negligently without due care and attention for the safety of the children and other persona in the neighbourhood and also of those who may be using the public road.
We have not accepted that she aimed at the deceased child or fired at the party with the deliberate intention of causing death to her or to any one of them. P.W. 10 only inferred that she was aiming at t.b. 8 children. The dying declaration mentions aiming, but in view of the fact that the deceased and P.W. 10 were standing at different levels from the accuaad, who was admittedly standing at a lower level, it is possible that both the deceased and P.W. 10 were honestly believing that the accused was aiming towards the children. It is probable therefore that she was aiming at the dogs or aiming high or upward from her lower level and this act of the accused cannot be conclusively held to be intentionally or knowingly aiming to kill the girl or anyone in the party because of the fact that the latter may be disturbing the dogs and the tranquillity of the bungalow by throwing stones at them and on the roof. We are therefore satisfied that the evidence produced by the prosecution has established a charge Under Section 304-A, Penal Code, against the accused. 1971 By her act in firing from the rifle in the way she did with the full knowledge of the children and others nearabout, she has done a rash and negligent act, which, although does not amount to culpable homicide, brings her within the mischief of Section 304-A, Penal Code. We consider her rash and negligent act in firing in that way as culpable rssbneea and negligence and not merely an error of judgment o defect of (sic) intelligence. Death of the child is the direct result of her rash and negligent act in firing the rifle. This rash and negligent act of beta is the direct, Proximate and efficient cause of the child's death. The Supreme Court in Mohd. Rauga walla v. Maharashtra State A.I.R. 1965 SC 16iG at p. 1618, hag approved of the following observation of Sir Lawrence Jenkins in Emperor v. Onkar Rampratap (1902) 4 Bom L R 679 :
12. The accused is convicted Under Section 304A, Penal Code, and sentenced to the period of imprisonment of four months undergone by her and also to pay a fine of Rs.  2,000, in default to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two months the entire fine, if paid, shall ho paid as compensation to P.W. 2, the mother of the deceased. The appeal is allowed as indicated above and conviction and sentence altered accordingly.
